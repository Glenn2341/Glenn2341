"1- Players get gold by selling on Trading Post.

2- Everyone is trying to sell on trading post because is the only way to get gold. 

3- No one buys from trading post because everyone is selling on trading post because they want gold. 

4- Prices are ridiculously low on every item on the trading post because everyone is undercutting the player before them.

5- Economy is fucked and everyone is poor. And then 5 day taxes."
We pay more taxes in a video game then Bezos did all year.
Buying a 20 k house then spending that in 5 weeks on taxes is just dumb.
"And I’m sitting here, scraping together gold to pay my taxes like a loser."
Oh you want to fast travel? I hope you're in the right tax bracket for that region
"Agree with you, the worst part of this game is the taxes for me"
"Yeah it really fucks over casual players or basically anyone with a full time job. Which is ironic because I feel like it's the casual players who would be most interested in buying a huge home and decorating it. Hell, that was my plan before I saw how much the tax was. Luckily, I now have my heart set on a cheap home in Monarch Bluff that sits on the Cliffside. It's small, but it has a pretty view."
The trick is to be so casual you haven't noticed taxes yet
"Town ownership has an upkeep cost that adds up to extreme amounts when considering station and fort upgrades. You can spend 500k in a week with all the costs. Taxes are definitely needed for this. 

This doesn’t mean the company will manage it appropriately though."
"It's weird, I didn't think amazon knew how paying tax worked."
"If we can't spend gold to keep towns good, then stop making towns degrade from taxes while they fix this."
"Does this mean that all of the northern outpost cities(ede Grove, great cleave, shattered) will be the new trading hub as no taxes?"
Ahhh reminds me of my server where the owner of Brightwood advertised for people to buy houses there then changed taxes from like 5% to 20% lmao
This is so easy to fix: remove the ability to withdraw gold from the treasury. Any donations or taxes then can only be used for company things. There's no reason why treasury funds should be able to be removed.
"Even if they wanted to keep the tax rate the same, at least pro-rate it then schedule it on the same day every week!

It's as if the IRS suddenly shifted to the lunar calendar and it was some random different day every year. It's mind-boggling why they did this."
"A good way might be to buy a house as a company and make it your headquarter, with some company stuff (mission board, company chest, exclusive shop between members, taxe-reduced working booth...)."
Good way to get around paying property tax.
"Our server is low pop but a miracle happened, all the factions are banding together to try and save 1 or 2 towns and level up all the crafting and refining stations there. The whole server will fight to defend it from invasions and share in the spoils and low taxes"
"If you don’t own Brightwood, Windsward or Everfall, I can promise you that you are dependent on weekly fees from your company members if you want to upgrade your city. The taxes barely cover the upgrades and you have to pay a weekly fee (for comparison this week we have to pay a fee around 100k) because otherwise your territory will be downgraded."
"all our towns were caputured with exploits. Tax is the last problem here... Game is broken, clans are broken. Exploiters ""win"", gg"
"Don't regret using my discount for the most expensive house, but goddamn the tier 4 taxes are kicking my ass. Think I'll just be homeless for a bit..."
Either make the current rate 5-20% monthly or reduce the tax rate to 1-5%.
Still have to pay your fucking house tax though.
"The same happened to windsward in my server, all very high taxes… yeah so anyway we are fighting a war today at 9 pm, don’t raise your taxes too high or the whole continent will revolt"
"literally 12% property tax, I brought my house in a 5% property tax village, my faction lost the territory and some marauders spiced the prices, also 11% trading tax"
"Travel tax is hugely annoying as well.  (Azoth)

Edit: I just pinged level 40 and am honestly tired of running around enough to take a break until something changes.   Also the lack of grouping makes it essentially a single player game in my experience."
"We just had this on Barataria. There were multiple “Gold Company” companies (numbered 1 - 4). Gold Company 1 owned Everfall and Gold Company 4 owned Windsward. 

They transferred out of the server. And as a departing middle finger to everyone set the taxes to extreme."
This happened with the first covenant zone bought in my world. I've never seen influence bar fill up so fast. They dropped the taxes after purple declared war on them because no one would fight with them. I would rather see the entire map purple than see that company on that map ever again.
Companies owning Everfall: Time for 20% housing tax.
We need ability to buy house in church so we can ignore taxes
Pay the tax from inside the house. The view in the map doesn't show discounts.
"No vendor NPC is a huge flaw imo. I've literally thrown stuff away to make room because the market price isn't worth the fee/tax.

No alts is also a huge flaw. I get why they did it but it causes a lot of issues. Eventually there just won't be low level players at all"
"There's no penalty to missing the tax payment, you just lose the fast travel and trophy aspect of your home.  You can always pay the dues at any point later, taxes won't continue to build up on you."
Can't wait to pay my mount tax in every city stable I want to park my horse...
I bought 60 of these converters yesterday. I was about to convert into a ton of tannin until I saw the 700g tax. I could buy 3x the amount of tannin from the AH. The tax needs to be reduced for this item by atleast 10x.
"If you lock the AH freeze everything. Property taxes and ESPECIALLY AH times. Having to spend hundreds in posting taxes because of this and people not being able to do anything because their storage has 4, the amount their supposed to have. First time it happened? Fine, mistakes happen, but they’ve done this more than once now and should have figured out a better way to stop these things from happening."
Sooo you can buy and sell in the white areas to avoid any excessive taxes?
This has happened to me several times. I just wait to pay the tax until the territory ownership or the taxes change.
Trick yourself into thinking you have it made by owning a home.  Then realize you will lose it all by needing to pay crazy high taxes.
Aren't we paying more in taxes than 1.8 to make 15 starmetal ingots?
Need to fix the crafting tax cost for using refining material converters next...
"I don't think he plays, there are taxes in the game."
I have been grinding out territory standing to get property tax reduction cards. That has been the only real option. But I agree it is pretty high even with those cards.
Housing tax is kinda high and/or too frequent.
It's like Amazon made a game to make people oppose taxes
"Ah yes, it's time to waste few hours after my real work to grind 4000 hemp to pay taxes."
"Who am I paying anyways? When I'm in the middle of the expedition repairing my gear, who the fuck is asking me for gold?

Also, when I'm using my own tent, out in the open for crafting, why am I paying taxes? To who? MY wolf landlords?"
"What's the point of giving 1.80 gold as a reward? Am I so disconnected from the actual game that I fail to understand the value of 2 gold?

You'd have to deliver 2k SM ingots to pay one week taxes for a low tier house.

How is this any different to not giving gold at all?"
"As a war leader for the Syndicate and friends with much of the Mauraders , it was a nice change of pace and a great bit of fun! We appreciate that we can goof off as a server and be a tight knit community, but also serious and competitive when needed.

Good win king! We’ll continue fighting to take back our thrown! (Lower your taxes, your people need to eat!! 😁)

-	Aeternum Trading / Tropog"
"They should make companies pay city upgrades and upkeep in various raw materials and goods bought at market price.  
That way the money collected in taxes goes back into the economy."
Do your crafting somewhere else. Don’t give them your taxes.
Press N to pay taxes
"Imagine how much trouble they would had saved themselves had they done this when enabling server transfers the other week

Side note, when they say wealth transfer, do they also mean stuff like repairs, property and governor tax etc? Just thinking this could get weird fast if it goes on for a few days"
In Black Desert they had Caravans carrying tax money to big cities. The guild owned that castle had to defend it to get more money. Other players could attack it and kill each other in the process because everyone had forced pvp on near caravan.
"Taxes due every seven days at a set time, crafting cooldowns resetting in full every day at a set time relative to local server time, and elite chest loot resetting daily relative to local server time. If there are any other daily resets that I've missed, do the same for those. It's small, but it's convenient."
"You had me at ""Bezos should be forced to...pay taxes"""
How is lowering taxes connected to gold dupes?
And my guild owning First light attacking King today is now collecting guild taxes 1k from every member every week to have enough Money to Pay Upgrades and wars etc because yeah those dont get enough taxes
"Do you pay the 1k? Cause on my server a couple of player had it ""just"" as a visual bug. According to the tax window they need to pay the full tax but they pay the reduced taxes."
"That's probably the most realistic thing about this game.

Can't avoid taxes if you're a regular guy"
"this happened on my server as well, a single guild in the covenant took like 4 zones and they got pissed that all of them was thrown into conflict all at once so they raised taxes in each of them to max. 

they said it was ""for the war effort"" but no one on our server likes them anyways so they're probably just trying to get as much gold as possible before leaving with server transfer"
"iirc someone made a post a couple days ago, or replied to one of these ""Eco is fucked"" posts where they mentioned they make almost nothing as a town holder due to themselves basically getting taxed (the town upkeep)

Gotta remember upkeep exists as well so its not just free money for them"
I won't be buying a house until they change the every 5 days thing. I'm a working adult with a family. I will never be able to keep up with paying taxes every 5 days.
"So could I use the first house discount to buy the 10k house first, never pay taxes on it until I’m financially capable, then just run 2k houses for functionality?"
"Hi, I’m a purple boy and I heal everyone I come across in the world that has less than full health. I hope you all have a good day and I love you regardless if you steal all my land and raise up the tax so high I go homeless"
Dont pay the tax until they drop it. You lose the benefit of your home for a few days but suffer no other negatives
I’m pretty sure paying my mortgage irl is easier than paying my taxes in this fucking game.
"We can't really say how much the timer moved but everyone got the 720hs achievement(I have 453). Every house got the taxes reseted so we had to pay them overdue. 

Elite chests got their cooldown resseted, Myrkgard has no mobs either.

I don't know what the hell happened lmao.

EDIT: Also, last night when this happened the whole server was kicked for being AFK, shit was wild

EDIT2: Check the war dates."
"So now all companies have maxed out property tax rate to 2,00%, players get a SLIGHT benefit but owning companies are going to get paid out like 20.00% tax rate.  THANKS AGS."
Was this onslaught? The raised taxes 45% in my server. Totally fucked my starting area
"It still is casual friendly. Buy a T1 or T2 house and only pay taxes when you want to use it. T1 house taxes are super cheap. You get the gold from that just by playing a few Outpost Rushes during the week. 


Since you don't have to pay back taxes, you can pay as much or as little as you want. The more hardcore gamers would be the ones buying multiple T3 or T4 houses and will be paying much more every 7 days."
"Death, taxes, and salty losers calling you a cheater.

Grats on your win though : )"
Amazon not knowing how taxes work *surprisepikachuface*
New World has a horrible way of creating two social classes. Some have everything in the game already and the others can't even afford taxes on one house (me included).
And paying taxes when Amazon doesn't.
He already pays taxes why do you think you can dictate to him how to keep his house? You gonna set up an HOA?
"I think each faction should have a locked town that they can't lose, with predetermined taxes and upgrades, that way theres none of this huge tax bullshit."
Keep leveling up rep and taking house tax discount in the area you’re going to buy your T4 house!
"9170 of gold to be spent (base tax) on crafts from T1 mats (and much more if you would like to buy it from the market)

Am I crazy or did they break the entire idea regarding leveling your crafting skills?"
"The 1st house purchase discount is supposed to apply to taxes, it shows as such in the menu when you buy.  Then you get stuck with several hundred more in taxes after the purchase.  This is a bug and I've reported it as such, others should as well for visibility."
"As I've hinted at in previous posts, this is the result of a single guild who has multiple companies on our server who controls trade hubs, each of their territories have their taxes maxed."
"Every game subs with veryyyy few exceptions are rough as the default. Perhaps terraria and factorio are the only 2 big games that aren't like that. 

This is a fantastic game. It has some really poorly implemented features though. Like the entire economy,  housing tax, the trade post system, pvp for the casual side, etc. These things really need to be fixed asap and Amazon deserves scrutiny over it.

That said its still an amazing game"
"The Governors Desk says this: ""The **governoring** company can set tax rates for this territory and pay upkeeps here.""

I didn't know governing was a difficult word to know. I'm pretty sure whoever wrote the English text was not a native speaker.

They legit could have just installed Grammarly and would have solved 90% of these issues."
Why can’t AGS just fucking clear the taxes and upgrade the stations to what they were before?  That is garbage
"Here peasants, keep your tax money, but we aren't fixing furnishing or the end game drops."
Just hope they never set tax to high or you'll be paying out over 3k every 5 days lmao
"Same for us on Lyonesse where we control the whole map with a guild of around 130 people.. I honestly don't know what they need to do to reverse this trend which will lead to the server being basically dead.

Not to mention all the abuse of one guild controlling an entire server  (taxes control, war selection, ...)"
I don't know why the devs think it's a good idea to have some ridiculous house tax and they don't give end game players a steady source of income. Everyone told me to save for the big house but i ain't paying 2k every 5 days to just get the perks without any good incomes.
Bezos is just using the game to get players to test his own tax evasion schemes at this point.
"Imo selling overpriced items is just as dumb and easy to find. Just:

1. Dupe gold
2. If your company owns a territory tell them to raise taxes
3. Just spend gold buying random items on AH

Tax money will be legit and clean, without any direct connection to you. AGS would have to reverse all AH trades you made and take away money from hundreds of innocent people or do nothing."
"So, as a French speaking person, our decimal marker is "","" and not a dot. The game LETS you input the "","" as a decimal marker in the market, but it disregard it when calculating. So if I input 1,99 price for 1000 items, it thinks I wrote 199... Good thing I noticed the crazy tax price the first time I made the mistake.

But it drives me nuts that the thing lets me input a damn "","" there in the first place..."
Capitalism is when purple man take zone from green man and raise taxes
"Got this too thought I would have a little look...

The localization files contains just a big list with lines of text for each message to be translated into other languages. 

It should read

> Housing Compensation

> Due to incorrect messaging around taxes for first time homebuyers, you have been granted {amount} as a homebuyer. We hope you continue to enjoy New World and your house.

*This message exists in english in every other langauge file, but in the english file its missing...*"
"On my server, a newer unorganized one, our faction was the last to claim a city.    
They raised the taxes right away.  Kept saying, we are sorry for the tax but we are using it to take our 2nd city.  They promised to lower the taxes after 24 hours.   
There was some grumbling.  But they did lower the taxes the next day and our faction has the most cities on the map now."
"Actually civil wars would be a great addition to have. 2 companies of my faction have stupid high taxes, and are kind of cocky towards other companies. It be nice to have a chance to knock them down a notch and take over."
"People are just downvoting stuff out of spite, y'all are ridiculous.

Thanks for the info, was thinking of grinding for a high tier house, but I'll settle for less with taxes like that. I only need an occasional recall anyways."
Bezos actually created this game so he could experience what it is like to pay taxes
"i dont get the faction hate; but i absolutely get the company hate, ive considered discriminating against members of two tax hiking guilds"
"I feel like they really need to balance the gold economy.  You wouldn't think it was a big deal if you didn't also have to pay taxes on housing, taxes on crafting, taxes on the AH...

I feel like there's too many gold sinks not enough good makers at the moment.  And I'm not saying it's horrid, it just needs tweaking."
"Totally agree. Also maybe something where you can contribute to the town to pay off your taxes or reduce them too. I feel like the town board/community quests should be more impact full on the ""life"" of our characters"
"I had around 10K, payed 2K taxes. Logged in and I'm now at 380K. dafuk"
"There’s pros and cons of both models.

I personally liked it being unlinked as well as it allows for better arbitrage and made taxes more impactful.

On the other hand, linking it will definitely spread the wealth a bit more so the obscure locations can have some value.

It also should reduce the congregation slightly in WW & EF which creates some of that local lag."
"One faction and set of companies (community) is doing this on our server and have turned it all yellow then turned trading tax up to 25%. I hope they are all banned, right now it's putting me off playing because you want a fair playing field and we don't have one right now."
Taxes are fucking ridiculous unless you’re the one in power.
"I govern in Cutlass Keys on my server. We   have the town upgraded to the level where we pay around 50k in upkeep. As we have 2 or 3 stations on tier 5 we are able to earn the upkeep from taxes, but any more upgrades and we would have to  spend our own money. 

What I would like to see is reducing max amount of upgrades that a town can have, so towns have to specialize and governors have to think about what to upgrade."
Please disable tax paying as well since I can't use the AH to actually earn wealth.
"What's interesting is how the game does not offer two options:

1 - Buy the house.

2 - Rent the house.

Instead we buy the house and then we pay rent on it. Which after a few weeks has cost the price of the house.

Thank god we can just not pay the taxes because otherwise oof."
"I'll give you 5 gold, save the taxes on AH"
"A company took over a town that I have a house with storage chests in, and jacked the tax rates. I don't want to pay 700 gold for my 5,000 house, so I'm just not paying it...

except now with this change, my storage is over-full because the house storage no longer counts, and I can't sell off the items until i get rid of items... What a well thought out change."
Yep this a great use of the trading post. I'm literally paying a rent tax to store it there. If someone wants it bad enough at 3x market who am I stop them. Looking at you thick hide....
"Still gonna crush these - need that sweet sweet property/trading tax reduction, house storage, and gathering speed"
"See, that would work if player distribution was around the same for all town. 
But it isn't, windsward and Everfall gain like 70-80% of the global taxes, cause everyone does stuff there. So these 2 towns can easily afford to go t4-5 for every single station, while other towns can afford 1 t5 if they are lucky.
So even more people go to those 2 towns as they have everything."
I'd be okay with the housing tax if there was some way to hurt or rebel against the owner of the settlement beyond wars.
Put a fiber in the TP for 20k (adjust for taxes) and the gold seller buys it. GG.
"GameCock of my server went rage mode and maxed out the taxes for MB a few days ago and kicked everyone from his company so they couldn’t change it, they had to let it get taken over by another faction to get rid of the taxes."
"On my server, a Marauder company has Everfall taxes set at high.  Syndicate moved into the fort and started a war.  The war was going poorly and, people kept whining for any and all Marauders to sign up to help the war effort.  Most of the other Marauding players kept putting in chat that they wouldn't help out unless the taxes got lowered."
Yeah and all the companies who own the territories are massive sociopaths. Thinking about walking from purple just to get away from the idiots setting taxes at a million percent
"Probably the biggest thing to note is that if you don’t pay taxes, you just lose access to the house and the buffs you get from it. You regain these things when you pay tax again. No need to rebuy the house.

Do keep in mind that if you abandon your house to move elsewhere, you get no refunded money."
"Depends a lot on the town.
Everfall and windsward make easily 4times the upkeep in taxes, while some of the high level towns have difficulties to pay upkeep."
Taxes at first were extreme and they did a lot of people shitty.  A lot of people from all factions hate them currently.
"The most valuable feedback you can give is what did you feel when you interacted with a system you didn't like.


For exemple, taxes on houses feels overwhelming and discouraging. 

That is great because they can compare to what their goal was. Maybe they wanted the player to feel grounded in the world and in the politics of the game. 

If that's the case, they can clearly see the system is clearly not perceived as they wanted and can take step to fix that."
Don't use converters. U pay Soo much In crafting tax
"It's not even a housing tax reimbursement... I have 2x T4 and a T1 and got zip... The wife doesn't even have a house got 350k...wtf ...

She was so happy thinking she could get her voidbent set only to find tp is empty already...


I would of been happy with no reimbursement at all if they fixed Jewelcrafting , wood dogs and myrk loot...

Just them and I would of been happy...


Instead they just dropped a golden nuke on every EU server"
"""Before you downvote me, think about it. We are trying to play villains to create interesting stories for the server."" (c) scums

Very interesting story for newbies, which started in Everfall and doesnt know anything about wars and taxes yet."
"or you could lose your deposit because no one bought it.  


Selling to a buy order has no listing fee and is an immediate sell. I will sell to but orders a lot of times for stuff that might hang for a bit if I can, cause now it's cash in hand, plus a lot of things are going for so cheap that you will get more money with a buy order due to no listing fee.  


Note: The listing fee is the large chunk take at the time of listing, both buy and sell orders take the company taxes though."
Still not really sold.  I was saving up hard for a $20k house in Ebonscale until I realized the tax discount is only the first payment and also after realizing how much standing I need to grind to be able to buy it.
"It's '08 all over again, people buying houses they can't pay taxes on."
"I let my company decide from 3 options:
1. Ding by paying house taxes
2. Ding by giving Barkimedes a bone
3. Going into the woods and killing boars

In the end I was told to give the good boy some bones"
"Territories have a flat tax rate of 5% on transactions. That being said, I think that's probably the best place to go unless towns decide to make their taxes lower."
"i have a new theory, you know how servers \`invented\` time traveling and move forward 100 days?

this time their \`compensation code\` time travelled and gave away people 100 days of worth taxes and stuff.

you never know xD"
No high crafting table and extreme taxes... Definitely not a place to stay. Also which server is this? Do they own just 1 settlement or more?
"Property tax should be decreased in general or at least paid biweekly/monthly and not every 5 days, it's a game and we shouldn't be overwhelmed with paying rent, especially that it became a griefing tool with companies setting it to 20% every time they take over enemy territory, just to fuck with you. My property tax in Brightwood was recently at 2720 gold when the enemy faction took over."
"u do not need to pay for it every time as u still keep the house but just lose the bonuses it provides and pay when u want them

u can also take tax rate reductions perks for that territory with your standing

also check what the tax rates are in that settlement as this can be an issue also and if all else fails take it over so u don't have to worry about taxes there really"
"Or like, an economic disincentive to upgrade lots of stations? like, i dunno, tax based on number and tier of stations?"
So I guess that's where AGS got the gold they have given for the Property tax discount fix. /s
They better put my taxes on hold too :P
My trash ass server just maxed out the tax rates and is selling territories to the highest bidding company
"It took like a month for them to decide a week was 7 days rather than 5 for housing tax.

I agree with you but don’t have much hope it’ll change. The list of QoL features sorely needed continues to grow."
"I wonder do the guild members have to pay the tax too? If yes, dont they riot too? And that guild got no idea in management lol"
He's the guy running all the companies who have all taxes set to extreme for sure.
"Syndicate/Lina known as grizzly + APEs from wow pservers. Uses every exploit they can this include but not limited to:
-artificially pumping tax revenue by listing an item and receiving more tax money back than appropriate 

-crashing/ddosing servers this happened last night, they prevented the war from taking place

-RMTing basically over half that money is being laundered

-and other war cheats/exploits"
I feel that the prices for material vs how much you need will be fine in a few weeks. The prices for things in this game NPC wise is not that much. Repairing is somewhat cheap and taxes for houses you can make in a single day. People selling eggs for 80g a pop and broccoli for 30g when recipes require 4-6. The trading post should be a source of materials to be traded of overflow stock and sustain of income not to be rich. It's not runescape or wow where you need billions of gold
"The best is the tax one. They gave a big breakdown before the linked TP dropped talking about how the entire purpose of the new system was to spread out tax money, and they didn't even test it."
"On our RP server, theres a company called Redcoats who have 2 settlements already and they both have high taxes"
"damn, that guild is doin work. what're their tax policies like? how do ya think things'll shake out down the road?"
taxes are way too high in this game considering theres not a lot of raw gold income
I document all of my mining for tax purposes.
I cant confirm but I've read that it will display correctly if you pay your taxes from the menu in your house and not from the world map.
"plays video game to get away from real life

**still has to pay taxes**"
Did Ole Bezie boy pull a Tron and stuff the tax man into his virtual world. So that’s how he’s been getting away with it all these years.
"Fuck house taxes altogether.

There should be two choices:

1. Either you rent the house and pay small weekly/monthly fee only.
2. Or you buy it by paying a full price all at once with no future payments."
"They definitely gave companies and and their leaders too much power. Imo, a portion of taxes should go into a untouchable fund and get spent based on votes by homeowners of the settlement."
"105 here, not planning to stop like at all.
Jeff would be proud to see how much tax evasion i did by not buying any iron from market."
"Let the bears pay the bear tax, I pay the Homer tax."
"This is happening on my server right now and the main company that is exploiting every war and has a majority of territories set taxes extremely high and are letting everything downgrade on purpose.. because they're transferring. So they're killing our server and taking a huge amount of money directly out of the economy to another server.

It's like EVE online levels of fuckery except unlike EVE we can't do anything about it so it's significantly worse."
I mean what do you think all that tax money is for :D it's to upgrade crafting stations and pay up other taxes
"420 gold for those levels from crafting tax.

I'm 197 armoring right now, haven't been farming any gold.  
I see my gold dwindle by the thousands FeelsBadMan."
"This is a simulation of how taxes work in the real world, duh.

A few million every week gets you a fountain."
"Probably not.

Weekly tax = base price of the house (without discount), so 5 000 to 20 000, multiplied by the tax rate set up by the controlling guild.

So, if you purchased the expensive house and/or if the controlling guild raised the tax rate by a lot, it'll definitely be expensive."
"If you swap weapons as you roll/as you come out of the roll, only in light armor, you don't get the 1-2 second slowdown coming out of the roll, making rolling by far the fastest way to move around the world for light armor users. Becomes taxing on my fingers after hours of play as well. Seems unintentional to me."
IMO you should be able to have as many houses as you want but you can only have 3 active at the same time (which you have to pay the taxes for). So if somone increases the taxes you can buy or activate a house somewhere else and if the taxes are low again (for what ever reason) you can re-active your original house. And of course reduce the min/max tax rates as they do seem quite high currently.
Once a week is too harsh imo. Tax once per month would be much more doable especially for the players who cant play x many hours a week
This is called the idiot tax
"I do wonder... Could you find 4 other people and offer them 1,500 an hour to gather for you? You get their inventories to hold stuff as you process and it might be cheaper for you to have them chop wood, get ore, etc. You would avoid the massive trade tax.

Has anyone crunched the numbers on that?"
Don't forget: town taxes are running a deficit :)))
Taxes only taken during business days 😂 M-F 🤣🤣🤣
"Oh that’s not it. They are trying to teach the younger generation to hate taxes as much as Bezos does. You go out and chop wood and smash rocks and get gold you wanna keep that gold not kick it into a pot for the common use. They didn’t find the rare drops, you did. 

“Oh you found the singular most rare valuable item in the game. Don’t you wanna share the wealth?”

Once an entire generation of kids have been conditioned to hate taxes the game will have won."
Taxes don't keep building.  Just pay the going rate when you want to start using it again
"I mean.. I’m impressed. 

Fingers crossed for server transfer tokens on store/mergers. 
The server I initially transferred to has been completely abandoned by every big guild and is an absolute ghost town.. towns are all being downgraded and before leading companies they maxed out all taxes in main trading hubs/cities in anticipation of leaving. 

Going to be a long couple weeks waiting for this."
I’m paying more in taxes then the cost of the house
"This happened on my server. Everyone decided to just leave and not craft there anymore. Everfall became a ghost town. Next day the taxes were at the lowest they could be. 
Remember people, vote with your wallet!"
"We had a big purple guild claim a few towns and put all taxes to extreme and not upgrading anything, rumored to be gold sellers. Green and yellow teamed up to declare wars at the same time on 2 of their towns. Now they only have 1 town and soon to be none hopefully. Even other purples hate them and will not help them."
"20.000 × 10% is 2.000.
It shows the tax rate on the map.
The tax rate isn't a bonus, it is the percentage if the house price you pay as tax. So if a company sets taxes to 20% you pay 20% of the house price."
There is just not enough passive gold income outside of taxes for the big companies to fuel the average players to buy mats when gathering them yourself is almost always going to save lots of gold. Mix that with very few consumables worth selling and no gear sink of any kind and the market is going to be very weird at the start of this game until we figure out exactly what is important and not. With gold scarce for the average player they just won't buy shit off the trade post.
"Slotting low levels in is just a surefire way to lose your territory.

We tried to give lowbies a chance on my server and we lost our main trading hub, marauders then jacked up taxes to extreme."
Game design wise the intention was for a guild to use some of that tax money to fund one of its members to be the weaponsmith. It's not really meant for someone to solo farm their way to 200 crafting skill in 2 weeks.
Have you skilled into lowered trading taxes? Have no other explanation other than that
What nincompoop decided it was a good idea to suspend gold trading but leave max taxes on? I’m starting to think AGS had zero idea what they are doing
How to get banned from a game. 1 do a sub(which is $5) giveaway for armor. 2 do crafting for sub(another $5) only. 3 piss off a large group of people on the server by complaining about taxes for 3 days. 4 give someone a recipe for a sub (just cause you said you do not he still subbed to and you still gave it to him). 5 complain you no clue even after people in your chat has figured it and act stupid.
Yes amazon decided they needed to one up all the dupers. Decimals and commas are hard when compensating taxes causing players to get 100x the intended amount is the main guess
Low taxes attract more people to use the craft stations which result in more money
""" Property taxes are collected 7 days after your house purchase, and every 5 days afterwards."" https://newworld.fandom.com/wiki/Housing"
"Lol. Our wars are purple just spamming 50 ice gauntlets and the entire area is just frozen. They won a war against us in about 10 minutes, we couldn't defend or even see what the fuck was happening. Then spiked property tax to 20%. Shit is ridiculous."
"To be fair though, we didn't misunderstand. The UI literally told us there was also a 50% tax discount.

The UI was just lies is all"
"Correct. 

It also doesn't build up a back tax or anything like that. Meaning you could not pay tax for a month and it wouldn't be any more expensive than missing a week. Basically you pay the tax to enable fast travel/trophies for the next 5 days."
"Not balanced at all, yellow is making mad bank on taxes and everyone else is broke."
"Please sir I do need to buy food, but with taxes so high im forced to choose between my home or my belly."
"I have a home then the owner of the city went nuts.  So I'm not paying that tax, ever."
Yes I found this absurd too. Just because taxes are too high does it mean your asset has zero value? No! We should be able to sell the house and punish companies that set taxes too high without taking a hit ourselves.
"> I’d like to point out that selling things to other players doesn’t generate gold, it moves from one to the other. 

Not only that, but you also pay listing fees and selling taxes.

The gold sinks in this game so far completely outweigh the means of generating gold."
"This happened to everfall on our server, as soon as syndicate took control everything went to extreme, I think it was half a day later? Everfall was a ghost town, everybody moved everything from their storages to another town. 

Fair to say the tax is now lowered lol"
They can't because everyone would just pick territory standing increase and xp gain all the way to 300 and then just respec reduced taxes.
"I was stupid enough to listen to youtubers, hey buy a tier four house first as you get the 50% discount for your first house..  so I did now my tax is around 1000  gold every five days, my friend has a tier one only pays 147 gold, I only paid it once not paying again. Wish I could just abandon it and get the gold back. Tax Every five days is ridiculous no way it will stay this way . I hope lol"
"I'd say housing and housing taxes are currently the biggest gold sinks in the game, so they have a lot to do with the economy."
"In all honesty, the game would be so much better if you didn't have to travel to where the item is listed in order to buy it off the trading post. Instead you should be able to buy from any post but you still pay the local tax from where the item was listed.

I feel like this would greatly help people spread out from Windsward and Everfall. People would be more willing to just list their items in whichever territory they are in."
The first syndicate company that took a territory on my server did this but they jacked all the tax rates to max before they quit.
Totally agree with this. Let me pay my taxes with labor in the zone.
"Streamers are held to higher standards in the sense that billionaires are held to higher taxes. He got a 24 hour ban and will have all his exploited gear when he logs back in...

EDIT - Feel free to report him to his sponsor/team. AGS gave a slap on the wrist but maybe TSM will give a knuckle sandwich.

"imo there should be a mechanic where you can upgrade <=t3 houses up to t4. you're basically pigeonholed into t4 housing unless you don't give any kind of fuck about storage, recall, or the house itself. tie it to zone standing or something, like every 10 standing over the original you can upgrade to the next tier so at 40 you could upgrade any house to be equivalent to t4 (with the gold cost/taxes increased accordingly)."
"First of all, when I bought the house, tax was supposed to be 800 gold.... then I realized it was only 1 time discount and now I have to pay 1600 gold every 5 day, well 1300 because thats the amount after teritory standing perks... still 1300 is insane amount for 1 house... now imagine having 3 or 5. thats 4-7k gold per 5 days"
"With current economic system you'll be wishing you had any money to buy anything in the near future.

Once people get their quests done, there is no money pooling into the economy basically at all. Repairs/crafting fees/property tax etc.  are eating all the small coin income you get from crappy quests and mob drops."

"Endgame is about experiencing the lower middle class north american life.   


Struggling with gold, paying taxes and getting no returns on them. Your always just a engine light (repair cost) away from broke."
"LOL. 

Imagine defending a multi-billion dollar company, that pays zero taxes, and suggesting it’s totally fine they release a game not fit for beta testing."
It takes 2 games max of outpost rush to pay for tax on a T1 house
Further clarification is needed to know how frustrating this was. Yellow owns 80% of the map.  And 80% of the yellow is owned by a company who just took a bunch of gold and transfered servers. We had BIG wars about about happen in all of those yellow territories to fix the fucking awful azoth costs and taxes. When the server fast forwarded all of those wars didn't happen. So we get to redo all of the work and gold to win those territories back
On my server our company has the lowest taxes in the server while everyone else either maxed theirs out or doubled the default. So everyone comes to our town to do everything and we make bank off it.
"This looks like my sever but green & we are also getting bent over a barrel for taxes, to a point that no one wants to help them defend when getting attacked lol"
Does this mean my taxes will be cheaper?
"THANK YOU!

This is the first source I found that explains the house taxes. Everywhere else just talks about the ""server"" tax, and then people complain about it being bugged.

They really need to make this more clear, maybe by showing the current territory tax when you buy the property, so there's some indication that the rate can change. I was super confused when I bought a house, it said the taxes should be about 400 gold, and then it immediately said I owed 700 gold in 7 days."
"The irony from a company that pays virtually no tax,  lol"
"It scales really bad, when you reach around 30% reduction in tax, next level makes increase it by something like 0.3%,  you can't really eliminate taxes"
"After hitting 60 I have been doing nothing but losing gold, every step I do I just lose gold.

You want to explore areas well if you die lose gold on repairs.

You want a house? lose gold on tax.

You want to craft and sell items? lose gold on crafting then hold up the items you crafted cost more to list than to sell so you lose gold anyway.

They really need to start giving more ways to get gold or lower all those gold consuming systems to 20% of what it currently is."
You forgot to add the tax on your taxes and to add some tax to the tax on your taxes.
And disable repair taxes as well.
"As far as a reason to do town boards, 

Town standing goes up to level 300. And it is quite a grind but that reduced property tax,storage space, and gathering speed are good incentives.

You can get 1600 extra storage space per town at max"
"What do you actually want? You don't own the town, you own a house within the town. 

>fight for my home.

Your not fighting for your home. Nothing happens to your house if you lose a war. Maybe taxes increase, that's it.

You are coming across as a whiny child. 

If you don't want to participate in the community on discord or anything then an MMO is probably not the game for you."
"Sooo they were going to do some compensation for people who declared wars, paid taxes and bought a house but they accidentally gave out 150k-300k gold to each person in the EU servers. Now we're 5 hours into a SURPRISE maintenance. Third maintenance in 24 hours. No warnings either. The servers just shut down"
We have some childrens guild in midgard that put all taxes to maximum. Way to get bad rep on a server
At least the taxes are rock bottom.
"Oh no, my house taxes"
"That's tax avoidance.

Tax evasion would be buying it from the market but still not paying the trading tax."
"Go the Ultima Online route and have a vendor with X gold per Y hours. 
Could even have a tax for Z% go towards the town.

Lots of possibilities.  Could even scale with level."
"So.. don't pay taxes on the house, and buy another house somewhere. Then when taxes for that town are lowered back down, pay the taxes to reactivate the house. Problem solved. No need to sell a house unless your house cap is full. Just my opinion"
So I don't have to pay taxes?
"If I paid housing  taxes this week I’d be broke. I play 10+ hours a week easy, this is not okay."
You're in for a surprise IRL when you buy a house and find out about property taxes. This is actually how it works (though the rates are WILDLY different).
"Super easy to buy a T1 house and pay taxes.  
Must put effort into buying 3 T1 houses and paying taxes.  
Elite to buy multiple T4 houses and pay taxes on them.

If you do buy multiple houses only pay taxes on the ones your using. If you plan on being in an area travel there and pay your taxes to use it and let it lapse when your done."
Damn Covenant not paying taxes!
I have 2300 coin and can't afford to pay taxes on the 1 house I have. I never bought anything more expensive than a satchrl at 1500. What the hell do you sell to have that amount of money?
"Just so we are clear, you want to be rewarded for not playing because that’s how other games do it?
I don’t feel like this is an issue at all. 
Earning gold is not that difficult, you can make enough in an hour to pay your house tax."
"Trading has paused, meanwhile.. I'm still getting an update every 5 seconds that my property tax is due on three houses.   Wouldnt be so annoying if I wasnt bored to tears with OPR and I was able to fight in more than just my companies invasions."
"What they actually mean.

""We couldnt really fix our issues with the time skipping so to compensate we have reduced your taxes so its about normal"""
"Companies get the full amount before reduction, so theyre all setting taxes to max. Made a similar post earlier explaining how this was going to lead to companies getting a windfall of gold and got called a democrat for thinking it was a bad move lol"
"Prefer to shop local when I can is all. Community wages plummet whenever Amazon warehouses enter the area, gobbling up better paying jobs and forcing workers into their warehouses. All while paying little to no taxes while we subsidize their terrible wages with our tax dollars. Amazon offers a hell of a service but they could do so much more to benefit society but Bezos hoards his money and plays space cowboy."
"I was always under the assumption that the tax deduction was based on whomever set the taxes in the first place. So if you owe 1K per week on that house, but the company in charge of said land asks for 10%, you’d be paying 1100 per week. But you have lowered your housing tax so much that now you don’t pay anything above the normal fee. One thing this game is good at, if nothing else, is showing you that nothing is free. But I could be totally wrong as well."
"Just don't pay the property tax if you do own property, you can reactivate when they lower costs."
one of the standing options is literally tax discount...
"Add few More ways of making money and remove taxes, its a fantasy game after all"
"This is how they did it in Albion, each station needed the crafted in game food to keep operating. If no one used your station the food didn’t get eaten. 

All the crafting stations were owned by individuals though, they were very expensive up front but made you insane money. You could set your own tax rate but if you got too greedy players would just go elsewhere in town as there were multiple stations for each crafting type. Until the cartel took over that is lol"
"Or just the 3 daily bonus faction missions. The first 3 faction missions you turn in each IRL day gives you 10x gold. 

Meaning just do the highest tier 3 faction missions every day. Doesn't even have to be PvP ones.

Hell, faction quests at Brightwood (lvl 20 area) give like 15 gold. So you're getting 150x3 gold every day just running even those. That's nearly enough for low tax T3 house.

You can get nearly 750 gold daily doing the highest tier ones."
"I would rather have an option to ""move"" house to other town with the same tier spot, for example T4 house can only move to another T4 spot in another town with a small fee that is the TAX of the new zone.

Just like in real life, you need to move all your furniture to the new house, so all the furnitures will be deposited to the stash and you gotta bring all those furnitures to the new zone; either walking or pay azoth."
"The same company holds WW/EF on our server, and they dont share tax funds. They do however keep the stations in those cities as high as they can, give resources/manpower for wars and invasions in other territories, and assist other companies in the faction with making territory plays."
"Did you not look at the towns tax rate before getting angry at Amazon? You know in game economy is player driven, right?"
"I mean it makes sense tbh. Like if they are raising taxes and being shitty yeah they can fuck off, but there’s nothing wrong with them wanting to have control over who comes to wars. I’d rather my company who I know are going to come with consumables and proper gear take all the slots than ransoms who don’t know what to do.

That being said I think that there will be easily a couple wars a week so active players should be able to experience them at some point."
Man Linnunrata has an interesting balance going on. Most of the wars are Green & Yellow vs Purple. Purple set tax rates to all max extremes first day after being the first to buy two territories and unionized the Cov and Marauders instantly. It's honestly a two faction server.
Amazon tax 😅
"imagine Amazon tax jokes getting old,   maybe by the time they add swimming to new world"
"I realized this just the other day. It does cost hold but it is generally quite minimal as long as the owning faction hasn't skyrocketed taxes. 
But players are limited to 100 listings I believe so players may m Ed to be aware if they are reaching the cap of listings."
"So theoretically, if all someone wanted was to have a nice looking house to satisfy their Sims-craving, they could buy it and decorate it within that first week and never pay tax on it?"
"Salvaging also generates gold but not enough to sustain repairs and house tax, I'm not 60 yet but I'd be interested to know what gold sources there are once the quests are all done. Just the repeatable ones constantly?

I'd like to point out that selling things to other players doesn't generate gold, it moves it from one to the other."
"Goes to 300 and you can eliminate property taxes as well as boost gathering speeds to obscene levels. So yeah, this is what you do at 60 to further enhance your character, since you're not doing it much with PvP.

I made sure not to take any of the rep boosts or exp boost options. Only gathering speed and Property taxes. If those aren't listed, then I choose the rep increase. Gotta think long term."
"No it couldn’t have, you pay taxes manually. If you don’t you just can’t use them until you go and pay them"
"I'm pretty sure it is because the crafting mods are tiered. I wish they said I, II, III, IV, V like everything else.

The fact that you have to spend money (taxes) to make the repair kit, and then also still pay gold to repair your armor is silly. I hope it is unintended and they will someday change it."
"I think it’s absolutely hilarious that the game creates this system of politics for territory control and taxes and people are surprised that it’s leading to toxic and frustrating situations. Like, what did we expect—for people to behave honorably? Ha."
"Just check the governor's desk in the town hall building for the town's tax earnings at each location and it'll give you an idea of not only which is the main one but also which is in decline (as it keeps records of earnings) 

Kinda cool feature actually because it shows how many houses paid tax etc"
Religion = Tax Heaven
"Yeah when I checked the tax ledger and saw how much they make it seemed crazy to me that all that money was going to them and they apparently couldn't afford to post any town upgrades on the board. If I imagined that that money was being handed out fairly to everybody in the guild, and they were all free to invest it back into the economy, I wouldn't mind so much. But the money always seems to be mismanaged."
That guy really wants those 20 coins - taxes...
Not cheap. Ever heard of posting tax?
"Greataxe light attacks pull you forward into the future where the tax is already paid, resulting in zero net cost."
TIL you can pay the tax remotely...
"The first War on my server, Amano Iwato, was the Covenant defending against the Marauders. At the time, Covenant had 2 zones to the Marauders' 3 and Syndicate's 4. 

Covenant defended, putting the Marauders to shame. Now the split in zones is 4,4,3 and frankly, I'm proud of my cultist bros. We are holding 2 high level zones which theoretically will provide more income through taxes as more people hit higher levels and use those zones more frequently due to the proximity to the endgame zones."
"I maybe worded myself poorly but not specifically flight paths, more like ground paths say I don't have azoth and need to go to settlement B from A and it's quite a distance, riding a carriage that is maybe 30% faster or something would save me some trouble.

Not super fast, but a little punishment for comfort.

And I'm glad you think so, I believe rebellion would be a fun feature to put the settlement in a neutral state again together with the default settings if the taxes and whatnot."
I have the 20k house with discount and my taxes are 760g a week. After a certain standing level with a city you can start decreasing the property tax with the buffs.
They will stop being funny around the same time Amazon actually pays its taxes
"Buying the biggest house IS the noob trap. The 50% discount is only for the first week, after that you're paying 100% of the tax, which is a minimum of 1k."
"except rent works more like a subscription, so you dont have to pay if you dont want to and the only drawback is you don't get the benefits of the house anymore, but if you desire to activate them again then you only pay for 1 week worth of taxes, not the whole weeks you haven't payed! also, first house comes with a discount"
"There is currently a bug where you randomly just lose your house no one knows why it happens. Happened to me the other day T4 house that I just paid taxes on and all my stuff just disappeared. 

https://forums.newworld.com/t/megathread-urgent-bug-housing-lossdisappearance/375270"
"Definitely happy I got the T4 with my discount.  However, I've leveled up my standing in the town to a point that tax isn't much of a problem. My next 2 houses will only be t1 though."
"Idk wtf you got these numbers. I have a tier 4 house and pay 800g per 5 days.

I guess that's minimum tax plus territory standing discount?"
I don’t think it’s the taxes.
">The first house discount reduces the purchase price, but does not reduce taxes. However, the UI indicated to players that their taxes would be reduced, and it was only after purchasing the house and needing to pay taxes that they discovered they had to pay full price. We will compensate any player who purchased a house before the UI fix went out with 2,000 coins.

Neat."
"FWIW, I'm pretty sure it's the tool tip that's wrong on this one, at least when I looked at it previously and punched in the local taxes on a calculator. So at least you aren't getting shafted the gold. 

Still, the absurdity continues..."
You still pay tax at outposts
Make a tax to post in global lol
"I mean, from bugs and exploits, peeps got plenty to complain about. 

I thought you were going to talk about the few companies dominating servers and jacking up taxes to ridiculous amounts. What the developers aren't breaking, the players certainly are."
">I was Govenor at the time so these orders were used with Taxes.

so, for this guy - embezzling funds from the guild/town for personal gain...

i.e. like most politicians of the world today!"
Bezos hates taxes.
You can avoid most taxes in game.
Wtf that’s diabolical and exactly what corporations in our real world do. I can’t imagine playing in a server majority owned by one faction with taxes set at 20% at all starting towns…wait that’s my server. Shit.
"for all we know, they're coming in as liberators, slashing the taxes and fees to the bare minimum! ...or they're tyrants becoming hegemons lol, in which case, i wonder how they'll be taken down somehow"
"What? No, the weekly tax is not the same price as the house... it would be insane.

https://newworld.fandom.com/wiki/Housing

Tax cost 250 / 500 / 750 / 1000 before the town modifier (uo to 20% more).


If what you said was true taxe wouod be 5000g minimum, yet you are replying to a screenshot showing 2.2k."
"Agree. although I can skip the stealing lands and raising taxes!

I drop a heal on anyone in need if I can."
You will lose the storage if you don’t pay the tax
"I'm level 40 and need to do like 10 quests just to pay property taxes. If anything, there is too little gold in the game. There just shouldn't be gold that bot's can farm."
"Taxes on my house today are 1,000.  Last time they were 267 I think.  I’m not paying."
"Tbh. If there are companies on your server owning just one claim, Then their income most likely isn't given out to their members. They have to pay Tons for town upgrades and weekly upkeep taxes"
"Yea except you won't be making money, because no one will go craft or trade in EF.

This happened in our server at the start. Someone put a high tax, and *lost* money because no one went over there."
"Dude all youtube tips I see always mention to buy the priciest house because of the discount, never did they mention taxes xD"
"Buy the expensive one first for half price but don't use.
Buy a t1 house in another region and use that till things are sorted out with taxes etc."
"Ya this is how I feel. It’s unfortunate but I prefer that over time you’ll acquire every perk anyway, rather than people rushing XP and gathering buffs then respecing to get tax breaks and crafting fees. Defeats the purpose"
"The biggest issue I see is that currently there is a money sink with taxes, as well as other costs. And the only way I found to make money was through crafting via the TP which requires other people to have money. But maybe lvl 65 portals will give good amount of gold when they fix them"
"Serious question, how do you earn the gold weekly to pay said taxes? I’m a causal, but I’m not sure what the best earning method would be"
People say taxes are from 300-1k every 5 days. Im waiting on my house for awhile as im a filthy casual these days
It is hardcore… dudes living in a box unable to pay even the taxes because he spent all his money grinding on some crafts. How much more hardcore can it get? He is sacrificing everything for some levels.
"Wait what? You do know that when you buy a house, you also have to pay money for property taxes in real life right? it's not like when you pay off a house in full you just live for free lol."
That's what happens when you don't have to pay property taxes /s
"Performance wise, I feel the game has gotten worse. I’m sure the bugs found since then were largely there at the time, but wandering around Everfall has become more taxing on my (admittedly shit) pc. Wandering around the town today I experience sometimes significant framerate drops that I was not seeing when there was a queue."
"dude, that one server that went a month forward in time and downgraded all the crafting stations to T1, and forced a month of taxes on anyone who owned a home. It had been longer than 5 hours and they said they couldn't rollback because it had been too long and they didn't catch it in time. So all those players just had to deal with it. AGS can't do big Rollbacks."
"server i'm on is kinda doomed, they've raised taxes to high in every town Sadge"
"Dont pay, move or realize that this is the exact game you paid for. They always had it as a player driven economy, player driven taxes. You signed up for this. It was in the many alphas and betas."
It depends on server and guilds. Some crafters will put their crafts in other cities for cheaper taxes
The first 3 faction missions you complete every day give you a 10x gold bonus. Main and Side quests also give lots of gold and from a certain level (35+ perhaps) you start getting a relatively steady income of gold from just killing mobs. All this is more than enough to keep you going be it repair or your house tax.
"I am exactly on the same boat as you. I get to play like 1-3 evenings in a week. Sometimes for about an hour during the day when the baby is napping. Just last week I only played for an hour, during which I was cooking IRL, so I only fished in game. I haven’t bought a house because I fear the taxes would eat me up. I am level 42."
"I farmed my faction gear already, im running sometimes that reekwaters 8minutes pvp quests and sell those grant runes. In our server i sell directly without TP (avoid taxes) for 1850g each. Always got someone to buy those like instantly.

Im in one of the most popular realms in EU center and lowest price in TP is over 2k with taxes to buy atm."
He’s done this in beta too. Intentionally picks smaller servers to dominate with his twitch followers. Jacked up taxes to max in everfall TWICE. Shit was really annoying tbh
"Not really bud. I'm on his server in his faction and he's spinning this all wrong.

The territory was getting downgraded due to non-payment of taxes b/c the company that owned it (who also owned Brightwood) couldn't afford the taxes. They wanted to get rid of it and decided not to defend it.

They didn't ask anyone to take it, they didn't trade wins. They simply waited for another company to contest it and chose not to defend it. 

**You cannot force a company to keep a territory.**"
"AGS disabled the Trade Post cuz they accidentally gave players literally hundreds of thousands more gold than they were supposed to get for compensation for a previous housing tax issue. So everyone took the money and completely bought out the trade posts on their servers. 

AGS had to do a server rollback and disabled trade post to try to figure out how to sort through the mess they made."
"Probably an issue with applying your tax reductions causing a ui bug.

I wouldn't be surprised if the game is showing the cost minus your tax reduction for the settlement you're in but the game is supposed to use the taxes/reduction of the settlement you're buying from."
I would wait until you understand how to generate money in the game because you will need an understanding of that to pay taxes and then once you grasp how much you are willing to do to make money per wk you will get an idea of the tier of house you can afford the upkeep of. If you can swing it the T4 is def worth it IMO but it’s not cheap to maintain.
"as an southeastern european i have absolutely 0 clue what you're talking about haha never bought a single thing from amazon, maybe a keychain or two from ebay, but thats it  
we still go to malls to get stuff

oh also, we do have option to buy stuff from amazon from neighbouring countries, but shipping usually costs about x6 times the price of item, than you have to additionally pay different country/state taxes and import fees, etc etc...."
"Single company owns 4 (was 5) on Valgrind, one of the most populous NA East worlds. They max out taxes too, making them really hated."
"Now I am the same. I was excited cuz I can't get a house in FFXIV, and when I found out everyone could get a house here I was like ""YEAH"" but then my friend was like ""I need to earn $1700 gold by next week for taxes.""  I was like... wait... what the actual fuck?  XD"
"I think the larger majority of players overall have gone syndicate if you judge it by the overall posts about them.  On my server, especially the first few days they hiked up the taxes to hell."
As it should be.  Movement tech should be taxing to do and rewarding for the user.  If they remove animation canceling for light armor users there's absolutely no reason to use light armor as a melee character due to taking mutual hits while attacking.
Is the t4 house worth it? I just got enough coins and can't decide on the t4 or t3 due to the taxes. Not sure how the gold flow is at end game.
This is an Amazon game of course you don’t have to pay taxes
I don’t know lol mine was 2000 gold in taxes and property taxes reduction didn’t work even though I picked the cards for it and got it up to -30% on taxes where my house is.
"The taxes cannot physically be that high. You're either misremembering, experienced a batshit crazy bug, or you're chasing clout."
"If players can only earn gold by selling on trading post, what happens when everyone is selling on the trading post to get money to pay for basic things like repair and house taxes?

If everyone is selling and undercutting the guy on the top what's the fate of the economy?

I don't buy anything because my gold income is limited to the amount I can sell before someone undercuts me. So I farm what I want and sell what I don't need. What if everyone just farm and sell like me? Who would buy?"
"I've only been 60 for 2 days and even after paying both house taxes (cheapo houses tho) and buying lots of lvl 60 gear I'm about 4k up without even trying. You get gold from high lvl quests, gold from mob kills, plenty of sought after mats to sell, etc.

Tho if I were you I'd buy the cheaper house. The mobility it grants you will make up for that one time save of 10k imo.

Edit: just checked, I'm like 9k up now but I might be getting lucky with desirable gear and legendary mats"
just don't pay your taxes done.....
I bought a little shitbox in windsward for 2500 and the taxes are only 300/week. Just playing for a few hours can get you that fairly easily! The extra recall point is a million times worth it in my opinion.
The tax on house is more like a subscription fee for using the house. You don't lose it it'll be there when you pay again and the taxes don't keep building. That would be INSANE.
"What does default on taxes mean, am dumb"
"TBH the tax stuff coupled with the lack of coin for 60+ without quests is keeping me from logging in.   I'll keep checking the patch notes, but I deal with enough tax and money issues IRL thank you very much."
"You forget you have to pay VAT on that tax.  

860 + 20% sales tax = 1032. Don't forget the small tip to Amazon for the helpful services and it quickly rounds up to 1050 gold every 5 days.  

Also Amazon runs on a 73 week work year system so squeeze even more productivity out of their workers/customers so being taxed every 5 days makes sure the share holders get solid gold space rockets."
Taxes and azoth cost seem to never bug out. Last thing that will break are taxes. As always.
"Has nothing to do with massive bans, has to do with the fact that no one can use trade post, all expired trades go to storage but of course those are full. Can’t buy items to refine down further and can’t go out and gather because you can’t put items in your full storage. Theres zero reason to play until they fix their shit.

In the meantime towns are being downgraded, wars and invasions still going, no trading, and taxes on houses are still ticking away.

The game is a shit show"
"If the Trading post is being changed then I want like a free respec of my territory standing levels. I chose trading taxes in everfall/windsward because that is what the previous system dictates, according to the new system my choices will no longer be optimal.

I didn't choose poorly at the time under the old system, but if I don't get a free respec for my standing levels then I will feel like I am being penalized by Amazon's poor choices."
"I believe what you are looking for is your inn. A house is a luxury, and as a super casual I have 15k gold and have no problems paying my tax. Just don't buy everything you possibly can off the TP and actually do some mat runs yourself and you shouldn't ever have an issue paying for taxes."
The taxes to make the kits would be like.... half a gold tops.... you get like 12g drop every 4th mob kill.  Why make shit up?
"As someone who plays as many hours as humanly possible, outside of work, I've always thought it was stupid that we had to pay sometimes 600g a day just for arrows.  It's like Bow wasn't bad enough, now we get taxed just for using it.  The 500 stack just makes it even worse because you can't just carry 50 stacks with you, or you'll be overweight."
"Wich coind does this game exactly trhow to you face?
You must be a lvl 20 levelining probably.
A casual player will never have gold once reached lvl 60.
He will be abled to pay his house taxes( if he ever saves enought money to buy 3 houses) doing OPR at max. An probably saving 1 or 2k gold a week. Wich is not even the value of 3 asmodeum, wich is what you require to craft endgame custom gear. :)
You ignorant."
"Repairs, crafting, house taxes, market listings"
"Because its based on taxes paid, if you had one low house, youd get not a huge amount back.

If you have 3 of the more expensive ones, youre getting 400-500K+ back easily."
"I disagree. These upgrades cost a shit ton of money to maintain and the general public will stop paying for these upgrades as they get downgraded by war, invasions. Who will pay for the tax increase because of the upgrades? How would you decide what gets upgraded? What if its constant bickering over what to upgrade and by the time you finally get a station you want upgraded, downgrades hit from an invasion or war?"
"This also happened on Hellheim EU, a marauder guild, EGs, who set the taxes to extreme in everfall.

The frustrating part is that there should have been a war yesterday for that town but the game bugged and queued 50 marauders vs 10 covenants."
"Not to mention it would completely mess up PVP. Then again they could disable mount if you're flagged for PVP.

Something I'd like to see is horse carriages that move between settlements. Hell, this could be another tax-driven thing.

Maybe the owning faction could set how frequently it leaves, but it'd cost more upkeep - thus they increase the tax.

Something to that effect 😇"
"I don't know where you read that the most expensive house has a base tax of 500g a week but that's just not true houses can easily have a 1k G base property tax, and yeah the company is a total bitch"
"Why is this getting downvoted? It's true lol. No company this big could get away with not paying taxes, if you're mad they're not paying enough that's a complaint for Congress."
"I'm still only lvl 27 so it might be the perspective of someone that level, but I agree. I was planning on saving up for the 10k house since first house is 50% off, but the taxes on it per week would be crazy."
Imagine. Having a “Prime” similar system that you pay gold monthly for to get discounts & reduced taxes.
Note 1 about rent (taxes) is incorrect. Taxes are not discounted by the first time buyer bonus (despite what the tool tip says).
My server looked like this but purple is losing all of its land from over taxing and drama the last 2 days.
Tbh the tax rate should be an annual one divided monthly.  Can you imagine paying a 20% tax every month on your house irl?.. lmao
In life if you had to pay 60% to 90% or more of what you bought your house for EVERY MONTH then literally everyone would be homeless. I see this comment in every property tax thread by people trying to sound wise and roll my eyes every time
"I like the system, allows you to make money in other towns by posting items/resources that may not be available in that town.  Plus, the whole trading tax system/territory standing is designed for each town to be its separate area. Porting to save 100coin on a transaction should cost you something in a market driven game."
"Evade those taxes homie!! Don't pay, move stuff over till taxes fo down, your company owns it or well until you can afford them lol.."
This happened a lot early on in Valhalla. Controlling company maxes out taxes if they think they will lose the territory during a war. Then the new controlling company can not change the taxes for 24 hours. Haven’t seen it in a while tho.
No joke. Happened on our server. We lost our land to green who jacked up all the taxes and didn't update or upgrade anything.  After many attempts we finally got our land back and put the taxes as low as possible. What was once a desert town is now flourishing. I swear that most of the land owners don't understand economics.
"Imagine defending a multi-billion dollar company that pays no taxes releasing a game that is unfinished. 

The game should’ve stayed in beta for another year given the amount of bugs that plague the game (at all levels/content)."
"I wasn't going to take the chance on a hunch that it might be showing the wrong value.  That is why I ran all the way back to check.  Good to know it wouldn't have charged the whole amount.  In the mean time,  taxes are free!"
"There needs to be a mechanism to balance faction size. Servers like that are doomed to die, especially if the controlling faction raises taxes to a ridiculous level.
Who wants to log in and spend all your time just trying to earn enough gold to pay property taxes."
Taxes
mining a single iron node will pay taxes on the house for 25 weeks? sign me up!
"We got tons of pvp,  active companies, fair taxes and balance territories! We're also a medium server only a little less populated than Olympus but with balanced factions all highly competitive! So c'mon down and make us the next High populated server in US EAST!"
"It's pretty spilt. Green got Windward and hiked up taxes to extreme, so everyone uses Ever fall in phel since."
":)

You're in for a surprise when you buy a house and discover you're paying a small tiny percentage of it in taxes. Unlike here where in ten days (or twenty according to different town taxes) you could 'buy' another house. 

Do you buy a second house after paying your taxes for the house ten times? Because if no then what are you disagreeing with me?

Really, it's all just a matter of naming things. Change 'buying' for 'renting' and suddenly it makes more sense. Still expensive, but sense."
Name 2 first world nations with no property tax
"Yeah, but property + school taxes (if you have them) are like 3-5% anually. Or $4,000 on a $100,000 house a year, or $55 every 5 days (0.055% every 5 days)

Or $6 every 5 days on a $10,000 house."
"This game is blurred as fuck. What they get right is Amazing, the other side of the coin is the idiots turning the economy off but not suspending wars, or invasions and property tax is still due"
You realize this includes refining and crafting taxes too correct? Not just property taxes. Any crafting will result in a high tax fee
"I should be able to turn my house into a brothel, or Airbnb it to offset the taxes."
">The fact any random Company that owns your town can tax you out of it is utter garbage.

Then raise an army and take the town from them. It's kinda the core mechanic of the game."
Amazon copying real life with taxes and shits but you cannot swim.
Anybody that has problems paying the taxes just are not playing enough. Do like 90% of players and list your shit on the trading post. Know what to sell and when. It's not rocket science.
"Yes, if you have asshole companies, but the way OP worded it makes it sound like they thought it was tax free."
"Casuals:  Why isn't every station in the city T5? Where is my tax money going?!

Also casuals:  Why can't I get in an invasion that will cost tens of thousands of gold if we lose?!

Also people can just steal all the repair parts which basically guarantees a lose.  And this has happened every single time an opposing faction member has got in.  So ya, not inviting randoms."
"Are you trying to pay your tax remotely? If so it doesn't use your discount, you need to be inside your house to get the discount."
"There is your explanation to were the money went. Taxes. And ypu probably made the same mistake i did 1x that was putting the number with , or . i cant remeber wich ones makes the space. That aint the games fault, its your fault for not double cheking, and i understand you are mad cause of it, its a good amount, but you just have to deal with it"
"Did you pay tax while being in the house or did you use the option to pay tax from the map when you are overdue, because in the second case the discount won’t apply"
That spot is taken by the notice to pay housing tax.
"4v4/8v8 arenas where you can que all time

More quests/dungeons, maybe lfg for empty servers

Better filter on market to serch per parameters

Lower money sink or easier money to come by. Each day i need to repair armor for 200+ gold, and pay taxes and you are broke and poor."
I can’t wait for housing taxes to be maxed in response
"As predicted.

With the current tax compensation offered by AGS, 20% maximum housing tax less 90% discount shows as 2% in-game.

The owning company still creates money as if the tax rate were 20%."
"as far as I can see, prices under 0.19g don't get taxed. listing item at 0.20g still takes 0.02g tax so it's better, for example, to list your item at 0.19 than 0.20-0.21g"
Just move somewhere else. If they don't upgrade their shit they will miss out on a lot of crafting tax.
Town not paying taxes should be forced abondon once they stop paying for like 2 or 3 pay periods and it auto abondon ontop of the game dieing is soo toxic that peeople hold towns only fOr tHiEr 50K gOlD
Until the merge happens they need to give a price break for town upkeeps or compensate for the lack of taxes…and cancel invasion all together for the low population worlds.. can’t even get a full team
"I bought my first house around lvl 40. I think I had 12k and bought one for 7.5k (with the first time price reduction) and I never looked back. I definitely recommend buying a house as early as possible, especially now that the taxes are basically non-existent."
"Inflation is a huge concern because of taxes that goes to controlling guild.

They are already reaking hundreds of thousands of gold without much property taxes since very few people have house yet (my guild has a territory, I've seen the money coming in). It means the guild controlling town will be able to completely controll the market and drive prices way high. Especially if they want to prevent other factiom from accessing rare ressources / best craft. 

Respec cost are just a drop in that ocean."
Can’t get taxed if you get everyone to do everything for you o.o
"I bought a 5k one and it said the tax would be half price (from 1000 to 500), but it currently says the first taxes I owe are 1000. So not really sure that's working."
Nope. I am on this server. How does 25% tax everything and them not defending invasions lowering crafting stations sound?
** Banned due to TAX EVASION **
But then I'd have to pay more in taxes
"That sounds like a lot, especially if you are the type of player who doesn't log on and play for multiple days, many hours per week.

Are you able to keep up with the taxes and still have enough G for other things?"
He said house price multiplied by tax rate which is technically correct.
we need to raise it by a lot. people like bezos used to be taxed at 90%. we should do that again.
ya those taxes are ridiculous
Not sure what you mean but I'm not really that tuned in to the chats. The taxes are all average or moderate though.
you.... dont have to... pay... taxes...??
I mean... a lot of it is a time tax but to say it has hundreds of hours of content is a bit of a fib.
F@#! taxes in a game.  I just use the house for storage and will never pay the tax.
It’s designed to help the company for upkeep of the town. Your gold property tax if it was lump sum every month would be useless to 75% of the companies that take that territory and would be OP to the 25% that hold it during most people’s payments.
"But Bezos doesn't even pay them, how could he hate taxes?"
After reading that tax rate I don't want a house. That's why I'm a nature lover. I'm out here camping flagged for pvp 😆 🤣
The tax system is important. No company is going want to control a territory if they have to foot the bill for everything.
"At level 56, I make about 2k a day just from random mob hold drops. They drop like 8-15 gold and its fairly frequent. Overall, if you want to gold farm at end game levels you could make property tax for those two houses in a few hours."
They are not the ones paying for all of the upgrades this is what taxes are for.
Go to Restless Shores and see what the Marauders are taxing.
"If a town only has moderate/low taxes it's very likely they aren't making money at all. It's really only 1-2 central hubs that can turn a profit.

Between town upkeep, projects, upgrades and invasions destroying upgrades anything but the central trading hub is almost certainly bleeding money at an exorbitant rate."
"I think it's a visual bug, from the world map and my house I don't see the same amount displayed. That being said I should have paid like 200 the first week (50% off purchase and tax the first week + 8% city tax..+ 30% tax reduction from territory, but I paid 380 gold ) !  

I bought the same T1 house in brightwood where I have 0% tax reduction from territory (and no 50% off first purchase) and paid 270 gold the first week.."
"It's both. Taxes and general cost of living in the game is super high, but gold making is very low for most things."
"You also pay less taxes in your factions zone afaik

Also the guild can give payouts from the profits although that requires a higher level of organization (still doable though)"
You pay 10% of your house purchase price in taxes every 5 days? I think you might be getting ripped off IRL.
"Buy houses, pay tax, buy gear sets to maximise returns on all skills, spend money on creating to level all skills. I had made probably 100k some time last week, now I'm at 20k."
"I agree, because I can definitely see myself put some netflix on and chain some outpost rush with no intention to really win it just to make some gold to pay for house taxes. 

If one of the best way to make moneynis a PvP instance, expect PvE player just joining for the money."
My faction (yellow) has/had one territory last I checked. Traveling via Azoth has always been taxing even with Azoth tools. You get used to walking everywhere after awhile. Gives me time to pick up spare mats and enjoy the view.
"I’m not even sure I’d call it power gaming elitists, players who spent tons of ingame gold and dozens of hours of effort to take and defend and upgrade a territory should want to defend it with their own guys who they can rely on right? And what do they owe to the randoms who have contributed nothing other than occasional taxes to the town?"
"Gorilla Gaming is a self-proclaimed sweaty guild, and Davenater claims they are the alphas of the server. I imagine as they take more territory they will jack the taxes up for a period and drive players out of that region. They are definitely a threat to the server health for anyone beyond the very casual players who don’t pay much attention to the taxes or guild feuds. 

Props to them for being a solid group of PvP players but they’re a huge threat and need a new Covenant guild to take that spot"
Yeah when I first saw my tax bills I had some regrets...but the impending tax burden motivated me to get out and farm my way out of poverty haha
You lose the storage bonus when you don't pay your taxes since it comes from the chests you place inside.
"You don't lose anything in storage, but it just puts you over the limit until you pay tax again. So you can withdraw from it, you just can't put anything back in until back under the limit."
"Wow, Three of those a week and I can pay property taxes and have enough left over to pick up dinner.  :D"
"Don’t ignore your gathering, and cooking can get you your last two levels worth of experience for basically doing nothing. You can also avoid crafting tax by doing it in your tent and not in town , your welcome, thank me later"
Did you even put standing points into lowering property tax rate
"Worst part is we all know that once they take the whole map they are going to either claim taxes forever and make millions of gold just to swap to a different more ""competitive"" server. Or so we've been told. HAA"
You lose the trading tax though and that can add up quickly
"Yet your streamer has T2 honing stones, No food, powerfully pots and trash gear? Musta been nice to use all them taxes to boost ur small group of friends to max."
"No, you're economical because housing taxes will rob you."
You pay taxes on your job so the US gov can turn Palestinian kids into skeletons with greater ease. There are no robust social programs anywhere that wholly support any Americans. Do yourself a favor and stop watching Fox news and consuming other forms of right wing media or at the very least least try to develop a sense of media literacy.
I am not a gov. or Evan an officer.  I am on a low pop server. there is 1 territory that is profitable and it isn't the one my company controls.  we all donate just to be able to do town upgrades as taxes only pay the town taxes.  Idk where you get this idea that the vanguard companies are rolling in coin.
"Most cities don't generate enough money with taxes, between the decreasing population and the fact that there is simply no one in them. My company owns Restless Shore and the only thing that makes us money is that we raised kitchen to 5 because there was none on our server. Otherwise we are loosing money.. and I now Cutlass and Mourningdale are loosing money as well."
"Hey, not everyone can afford the 20% property tax!"
"I took a sip of coffee and almost spat some out when i read ""Unhoused"". That city probably upped his taxes to 25% and he couldn't make ends meet. xD"
I’m about to create my alt Character Bernard Samders and start advocating for wealth taxes on the rich.
Well 10% tax on a 20k house is 2k
"They add extremely limited profession points, take up inventory, require multiple individual clicks per item and still use repair parts. They are the hottest of hot garbage. You may even also pay tax to craft, I haven't checked that. Until their functionality is reworked there won't be much demand."
They want my tax... but kitchen not even 4. piss off!
I just wish town ownership was more democratic. Like... I own a house. I pay taxes. Why do I have no say?
"Works as intended. You can only set taxes in a range. Housing for example 5-25%. Which is actually a lot less than in real world. Now imagine no restrictions at all.

And above all you don't have to pay the taxes/craft/trade there. One thing I want to be added to the game is a way to sell the house to recover some of the cost. That way there will be a big incentive to have lower taxes or people will just move to another town."
"> Housing for example 5-25%. Which is actually a lot less than in real world.

Where do you live where you pay more than 25% of your house's value per week in property taxes?"
Either pay a lot of gold in taxes and posting fees to get the items out of the purchase price range or put it up for cheap and pray someone doesn't see it before you can cancel
It says the discount is for the taxes as well.
I’m pretty sure it’s just the first tax bill.
How is your property tax 2k? The most expensive house has a base tax of 500g/week. Is your territory at 400% property tax somehow?
Actually you know what. I bet I was remembering the midtier house tax. My bad!
"Also, apparently the 50% discount is meant to apply to taxes as well, but that seems to be bugged?"
I should be cooking at camp to avoid taxes huh?
"Yep, if people are getting tired of defending it then let it go. Areas will be in constant war and taking on a region is responsibility.

Asking for a cooldown is basically saying people shouldn't be able to influence the game for a certain amount of time while we grow fat on the taxes.

No taxation without representation! (Or war)"
"You're saying the game is properly coded, yet it is not.

My gpu spikes, even when limited by my gpu engine, pulling 375w..., When I have it set to 325w max. There's something going on with the game, that doesn't happen anywhere else.  

The menu needs adjusted, but the in-game fps limiter shows 30/60, yet is 42/82...  

I have many other games that are much more graphically taxing, yet this one has caused more shutdowns and black screens than any other I've played since owning this GPU for 10 months now."
"You already can, place storage chests in a house in that zone and it'll increase the max weight by x amount, assuming you pay the taxes upkeep. You can probably find some on the trading posts"
"Unfortunately, that way of storing items is cheaper than house upkeep. An oversight, but mostly we need lower house taxes."
"I get around 52 chest a day, it's how I paid house taxes and other things. So it mattered"
"Ah, hopefully that’s the case. I didn’t pay taxes on my house when purple took the city over and it says I’m 300 over storage"
"I can confirm, if you not pay tax you can withdraw from storage but not deposit... I tested..."
"Selling is player dependent. Its not a sustainable model.  
Owning a house with property tax is an even bigger sinkhole for a gold required game with no money printing. :("
This isn't even possible to be taxed that much unless it's a bug. So I'd recommend searching if it has happened to others.
"You don't lose your house, just wait until they make it better for casual players. And fk the company that raise taxes"
"If your not selected for a war party on a regular basis, I would say that paying house tax would be a net loss of money. I would stop to pay taxes. Sure, you lose some perks…. But you don’t really need them anyways for the content you do"
I agree. I personally really love it! It allows the PvP and territories to actually mean something because of the taxes each place has. It’s a game that revolves about wars and continually attempting to take over places. So all the systems in the game have to support that otherwise the main system of the game doesn’t work and you just have another WoW.
"This is how world works, move money from the poor to the hand of the rich, i lost all my gold and now can't pay for the taxes, but the Governor is happy..."
"The issue with ""once a month"" tax rates are tied to the game mechanics of territory control.

If you only have to pay tax once every 30 days, there is no guarantee the controlling faction will get paid (sure some will need to pay pending the start of their purchase)

With short tax windows it benefits the controlling company.

As a solo player it doesn't benefit me but that was the logic I saw behind such short tax weeks"
I dont want to  pay taxes just call me Amazon
"Tax income is capped at 100,000 you lyin"
"This is why i'm holding on to not buying a house. I have 35k right now, damn right i can afford a house but i dont see myself affording all the taxes every 5 days. It's a dumb design by the devs. I'm waiting for them to balance it out with some real source of incomes instead of pathetic 1.8g town boards rewards."
YIKES imagine selling trash drops for 20g..... their sell to vendor price is their salvage price. You arent supposed to have 500k gold this isnt WoW getting 20k for a home is supposed to be a fairly significant achievement. Getting 1k for your taxes each week is supposed to be not a 20 minutes in amrine objective.
"I’ve never had an issue with my gold yet and I’m constantly donating to my company and paying taxes on multiple Houses.

I don’t think gold is hard to make and honestly the need for gold in this game isn’t crazy. You just pay your taxs with it and contribute  to you company. Crafting fees etc are so low. At 60 500 gold is nothing for a respec. A vendor npc would be cool. It would make the economy even worse though. Unless maybe the vendor only bought certain items per day  and certain quantities"
The biggest gold sink right now is actually the tax money that goes to the companies and they use that tax money to build up workstations and get it destroyed by invasions.
"Hell, I wouldn't mind having to put gold into circulation myself. Let us use our gold ingots to mint new coins. The lion's share of coins made can be used for settlement tax. If I make 1000 coins, give me 100."
"Highly recommend the cheapest house in a major trade hub, paying to reset the 4h recall is very cheap in terms of azoth and frees you up to set your Inn wherever you are questing. If you know you won't be playing just let your taxes go they don't build up. Also let's you move storage around between faction owned places and you can buy 5 global buff trophies. Very much worth it for everyone basically."
"I assume the taxes keep building, so if you get behind you may never catch up? Or do they pause?"
"As a non-native speaker hearing that ""default"" equals ""not paying"" in relation to taxes sounds so surreal and funny."
"I don't think the design works, and I think many would agree. The tax structure only works in at most 2 cities, and generally from what I've read its not even a crazy amount over what it takes just to keep things running."
If money is a concern buy the cheapest house. The taxes aren’t bad on theT1
Here I am with a t4 house in first light lmao. I barely get the gold for property tax but it's my only house. I have my inn up in edengrove so I can essentially travel anywhere on the map for cheap. 4 chests kinda nice tho and I almost have high enough furnishing to get t2 chests. Should make good money from selling those
"DONT TOUCH OUR SWAMP! 

on a side note I've actually had other faction level 60s craft me bags when I asked. Everyone is pretty chill. Marauders were getting our butt kicked at the start but it's evening out now. 

The housing tax war is freaking hilarious. Purple takes a territory from yellow they increase property tax to 20% yellow takes purples territory and does it right back. Fun times.  Lol."
i found that the other day and was really curious how having a guy named Goldstein as the boss of The Tax Collector made it into the final release lol
"You didn't get it, he can't put things on sell because he doesn't have the money to pay the tax"
"I said this in the first week of launch. There's no incentive to PVP. At max level when you have your best gear there's literally no reason to craft anything so there's no reason to care about taxes and controlling citiies.

It's super poorly designed."
"35 fps during 10v10 pvp,
40 fps while hanging in windsward or everfall towns,
T1 mats are more expensive than some higher tier mats,
Irritating player driven economy,
1 company settles to a specific territory and rest of that faction gathers mats as slaves to pay the taxes,
Unbalanced class systems.

With these issues, no! But if they gon fix or add some, I may consider."
"There is no endgame. The only thing different I am doing at 60 is occasionally farming for watermark gear. Everything else is the same as it was when I was a lower level. Farming materials/crafts, townboards for rep, and doing some quest chains.

I'm still having a lot of fun minus the azoth travel tax. I'm pretty done with all the running around. I got on for about 3 hours earlier to do the fishing quest chain and I think I spent 2 hours running. :')"
"Windsward is the trading hub on my server. So I got a house there 

Morning dale has way lower taxes and the company running the place seems pretty chill vs brightwood is taxing the shit out of everyone. 

My third house is undecided i thought ebonscale might be good but with morningdale and windsward i can basically move around the map well without paying to much azoth at any time and i pay less property tax for a third house i don't need."
"They help with azoth and storage way to much to avoid them completely just buy the small ones you'll thank me later. 

You don't have to pay your taxes only pay when you want to teleport think of it like a way to teleport with gold rather than azoth. 

Your first faction missions of the day give a lot of extra gold and gold is also pretty easy to make salvaging gear from portal runs if you get a Zerg together. 

Also if you can get into invasions or wars they are also pretty solid cash."
"Literally every MMO, with a trade/economy system, has bots/gold sellers. This is not an exclusive issue because of taxes or whatever"
"Does someone know how unpaid taxes work? Recently another faction/company took over the city my house is in and set the tax rate to extreme. Can I wait until they lower the taxes? I rather abandon the house rather than pay 2000g.


What happens if the previous faction takes the city back? Will i still owe the 2000g?"
They should make NPCs pay taxes for living in towns also. See how many homeless NPCs there are after that lol
"There's no back taxes. When you let it lapse you lose the fast travel, trophy buffs, and you can only withdraw from your extra storage."
Ya at this point I just wanna know how they do it so I can do it myself so I can afford the taxes
Housing Taxes don't stack. You still only have to pay the normal tax once after being gone a long period of time.
"When they initially launched your first house being half off, the UI made it seem like you’d be paying half off on taxes forever. This wasn’t the case and they’re basically giving everyone who bought a house before they fixed their UI 2000 gold as a “sorry we fucked up the UI” present."
"Sidenote: Onboarding new devs into a team and project this massive could take >6 months.   
Hurray, very smart, very clever, much wow, smoll salary, poor management, avoid taxes."
Yeah it works just like inn recall and can be used as often as you want. I was pretty hesitant at first but now I have 2 houses and with the convenience they offer I'm able to make more than enough to pay their tax
yes. faction has little with that. one shared ah on the entire server. the tax difrence between distance and faction tho.
CHeck them taxes
"Our well populated server with no particular drama recently got joined by a 200+ members guild of tryhards whose only goal is to conquer the whole map, put exorbitant taxes everywhere, then jump to another server (they already killed one). Sigh"
"Except most of these governors piggy back off their factions carrying them through war, and then hog the the servers tax money to themselves. If you think that’s fairly, then I’d like to offer you a job sir, because I got a great position for you."
"Since you are on a low pop server, you won't make money from taxes. 5% of 100 is a lot less than 5% of 100,000. Additionally the costs related to ownership are static whether itd a large or small server."
"Same dude. New world suddenly feels like real life, hard work, short in cash, daily expenses, taxes, corrupted covernors...."
I think i’m right by saying they will unify all markets so no more teleporting for stuff in another market and they will also extend the taxes period to 7 days.
Towns will be encouraged to set their taxes low.  Everfall can fund itself through house taxes anyway on most servers
Amazon as a whole will not be effected. If the game fails it is a tax write off. Oldest tax trick in the book.
"I've seen this happen a couple times by companies taking advantage of a territory another faction has owned for a long time. Typically they drop them again pretty shortly after, but the extreme taxes might catch a few people who don't pay attention to territory control."
"I actually agree with OP. The changes are net painful. 

Lots of little things. Like moving slower after you attack with a mage weapon, way slower, and for a longer period of time. 

The crafting one really sucks though. It’s so crazy. I just don’t get it honestly. 

And balance around taxes and guild income is bonkers."
Happened to us 5 times now... towns all set back with downgrades because the game jumps foward.  Need to pay all taxes again.  Probably won't get any compensation.
I mean he's not really all that wrong. You could always get your company/faction and try to take it over. Then you could put the taxes you want while taking advantage of the reduced costs as owners.
"no I had around 35k, 500k is the max coins I paid tax's yesterday on all 3 of my houses so im guessing they messed up the tax rebate thing"
This is why you should always pay your taxes kids
"Where will the cost come from? If they cost nothing to start and people can just push it to t5 thru town board only, how are small town owners without high tax revenue supposed to pay for up keep? It costs over 150k per week just for the upkeep if you keep upgrading stuff, some towns get like 5-20k a week."
"Honestly, the game gets pretty tough to solo around 50 unless you're hella overleveled. Try and push some territory standing for more reduced property tax.

And since you're 50 sign up for every war and Invasion you can. Easy gold."
Why are you able to get banned for raising taxes…
"Happened with Windsward on my server. But no company can abolish them. All lose in 50v50.

Ppl with brain migrated to brightwood / everfall. But still Windsward is extremely crowded - looks like my country citizens. Can be taxed extreme and still oblivious ""WhAt ArE TaXeS?"""
You keep your house but it is no longer usable until you pay tax
you pay taxes based on who owns the settlement
"Weekly tax you have to pay or you lose access to the house's benefits (recall, storage and trophy buffs). It's in the hundreds of gold for tiers 1 and 2."
Do you know if it's a permanent reduction on the taxes? Or a reduction for the fist week???
"First of all, Mr. Bezos, you are still the richest man. Secondly, for tax purposes my account balance will remain undisclosed."
"He said something like flight paths. So carriages, which would be cool. The carriages could be taxed by the owning city just like property and crafting taxes. I think this is brilliant, as long as it costs coin and not azoth."
"Nah, still I dont like upkeep mechanics in games. I play games to get away from RL, so paying house maintanence and taxes in game, no thank you xD I already being taxed for crafting xD 

I understand that for active players this mechanic is ok, however I play like once a week, 1-2h of relaxing questing/mining in a pretty game. Like, not calling it bad design or anything, just not for me"
It seems if you've taken any property tax perks it removes your 50% discount? From what I've read.
Yes and no. If it costs me 200coin to buy the raw material for a pickaxe that sells for 300coin then he is making money and xp. Yes it might take time to sell and you have to do a lot of math for sales tax but it would be the best way to level. However Most people don’t have the money to buy the raw material at the moment.
"Fucking Cantahar man...  
High taxes and not enough players for the other factions to even stand a chance."
Yeah absolutely. I included the war part but had no idea about the taxes or the transfer of ownership. Damn.
You are just trying to tax dodge
Is the discount on the weekly tax permanent?
The only discount on tax is the general 30% discount on every tax if you're a member of the guild controlling the city
"What the fuck.

If I owned a territory I would have all the taxes set to low. People are too greedy."
"They are really hated. Especially because their response to the high taxes was ""just don't be poor."" 

We are also probably one of the few servers where Everfall is actively avoided just because of that company and their taxes. It's sad cuz it's such a nice town too."
"You do not lose the house if you don't pay taxes, you just can't move furniture or use the storage bonus. So in the case of this picture - I would refuse to pay taxes until it came under new ownership. When you do decide to pay taxes, it's only one week work - not cumulative. 

It's not that bad really."
"Most expensive house at 20k buy-in is only 2k a week in taxes.

Keep in mind, not paying taxes don't mean you lose your house or anything inside. You only lose access to the perks, such as trophies and fast travel. If you're not using a particular location during a given week, just let the taxes lapse."
"It's just listing fees, think it's like 3% + what ever the tax is to modifiy it..2.5-3.2g for 100g worth of items."
"Thank you so much! It’s very helpful. One more question, do you know if the first house tax discount is permanent or only the first week?"
"I'm not sure I'm afraid. I think it was supposed to be permanent but I heard a lot of complaints that the tax discount doesn't getting applied in actuality. Maybe they went back on the tax discount. There's nothing official what's going on with it unfortunately.

Edit: I asked around and people in-game say it's only the first week that is discounted."
"What I’m worried about is the weekly tax, after the first 2 weeks we will be paying full tax, which is insane IMO, how are you gonna keep up with the rent every week?"
"The 40 random pick is good, it makes it so other people have a fair chance to enjoy the invasion, also, even losing, you get avg 500 gold, imagine 50 x 500, that's 25,000 gold each invasion minum for a company, that's a lot on top of the tax they already get."
"Though your idea could have worked in an MMORPG where players couldn’t throw cash at each other, it won’t work here, they’ll just send gold to their elites or gather them from the company taxes to fund their elites, it’ll be the same thing. There needs to be a hard coded cooldown to prevent this."
"What do you mean you don't have to pay taxes? 

My understanding was that, if you don't pay taxes, you still have a cosmetic house, but home fast travel, trophy buffs, and storage will no longer work. You'll just have a furnished, useless home."
You keep the weight additions even if you don't pay the upkeep on taxes.
Which town is that? We have one called Evertax that has had the max tax rates since launch :/
"probably, i think AGS needs to shape up , everything else is on 99.999% uptime.

I can online bank, do my taxes, pay my bills, order food, watch netflix, buy films on amazon prime, call my ISP, etc 365 days a year 24 hours a day.

its not unreasonable to think a modern MMO created by a sister company of the biggest cloud hosting provider in the world. Wouldn't be doing patch releases worse than competitors were 15 years ago."
what happens to items stored in in-house chests if you fail to pay taxes? I'm assuming you lose access to them?
"I just bought a T4  house in Brightwood while it is controlled by my own company. Tax rate currently set to 5%, I get a 30% company discount, and I have 19.1% reduction in property taxes due to my territory standing.   My first tax payment is 537.98.

If it was a 50% discount off of first week's tax on a t4 house, it would be less than 500g."
"Dunno why this keeps being said, it's not true. If you don't pay your taxes, you lose the extra storage as well."
"Smaller long term gains. 

Lower taxes makes people want to transfer to that city for their crafting, gather etc. 

And people will also do more business in that city. 

It also offer a more sustainable income for the company since they will have most likely gain longer term people staying in those cities or even urging their friends to make that their starting zone etc."
Do you personally move away from cities with high taxes?
"They really wanted to push player-based economy, which sounds great on paper but totally bad in practice, since money sinks like house taxes exist."
"Those taxes and fees get put into upgrading settlements, which costs 10s of thousands of gold.

Biiiiig sink."
"Real drama or fake drama? 


The most dramatic thing in my server is a company jacked up its taxes and the players got butthurt about it to the point of mass reporting him to get him banned. He got unbanned a day later and has made fun of them ever since."
"There's a limit to how high you can set the taxes, I very much doubt you can even set them that high."
What’s the tax rate? Open your press by pressing M then click the settlement details and you’ll see the tax rate for that settlement.
"get 25% reduced prop tax from standing fairly easy (i have it at lvl36; you need 30 to buy the house)

costs me 800g for my tax which is like 2 hours of farming hemp near boarsholm"
"The annoying part of the tax is the outright lie of the UI when you buy it that the 'half price first house"" discount applies to taxes"
"What? If you don't care about the extra storage then t1 is 100% the way to go since you can just reset the fast travel with minimal azoth. I mainly just want the trophies and said fast travel, why pay 4x extra tax for a reduced teleport cooldown that cost f-all to reset anyway?"
"You don't have to do all of that, you chose to do all of that... it makes sense to have separate trading posts in a game where there are trading taxes determined by the controlling company. Don't like the high tax in one area? Trade will start to shift to another, but this is intended so that you can't just buy all of the items from the area with a high tax from an area with a low tax. It makes sense and also makes for a very engaging market that allows you to make good money in different ways."
"Let me make sure I've got this.  You are Syndicate.  You bought property in a Marauder controlled territory, thereby betting against your own faction and supporting an enemy factions war effort with your taxes.  Now you are upset that said territory has been taken by your faction and the taxes have been cranked up to punish the pests who forced wars over the same territory every 3 days?  LOL"
"When I saw the taxes for the 2500 discounted house I immediately started panicking lol. Because if I was only able to scrounge up 9000 gold by level 30, there's no way I can afford a house in the long run. Might just have to camp in the woods lol."
"Damn, how high is your towns tax?"
"Your work invalidates your comment.🤭 And yes! I would really like to know how many green woods and iron ores I need for an item. 

Then again, maybe I don't. I am already a little frustrated by my house tax. If I see how many base items I need for certain things, I might get daunted and just give up.🙁"
"Mine is working. Did you already buy the house or are you just looking at the tax? Mine said 500 gold on purchase, after purchase the tax was 800ish, after all of the discounts I got it down to 400ish"
I love how taxes in a video game are just as confusing as they are IRL
This looks like Duat server... i hate this server. Yellows own 7 territories... all set to extreme tax.
That does seem to be it. Luckily they have lowered the taxes
Marauders capped like 4 zones day 2 on my server. Set all the taxes super high. They're now far more reasonable. I sincerely hope it's because holding 4 regions cost them a FUCK TON of money because everyone abandoned those cities.
"If it's Everfall or WW people will stay. What are you going to do? Gather all your material in WW and walk up to brightwood every time you want to craft? 

Move manually your inventory between those cities to come back later when/if taxe are lowered?


And you can't sell a house, if you bought yours there, filled it with chest, you're screwed."
This happened on my server. Green team literally begged us in global chat to take over a territory owned by a company whose leader ramped up taxes and left. We fought a war 50vs20 and now that place has reasonable tax rates
"A lot of the gold that disappears are taxes wich goes to the companies that own the territories. So the money doesn't disappear, atleast not all of it, the companies have it.. Kinda like real life if you think about it. Ironic"
">the taxes don’t offset the cost of upgrades, so taxes in the end are just deleted

Yeah, that's what my comment was conveying"
"I'm ok with that, the problem is that there is things that must be payed with gold, I cannot pay my taxes with iron ingots, my governor cannot pay with those the upgrades that the ""system"" charges him everytime an invasion occurs.

Many years ago I worked in a supermaket and the owner was in a rough time and offered to pay employees with food and goods, the thing is electric company doesn't take food to cancel my bill, they only take money."
Had no idea about the taxes thing...I'm purple and my whole server is basically all green lol
Council tax/property tax is a thing.
oh wow didn’t realize owning a house got you all those perks. I’ve just heard property taxes are high and it’s almost not worth owning a home because of that. I haven’t had a good source of income this far into the game. Level 29 and I’ve got like 5k and I never buy anything either.
"Yeah, if you play casually I don't think it's possible. Also what if the 3 city you have your house in increase the tax to max ? Will it be still ""easy"" to keep ? I don't think.
+ ATM maybe you can make money but wait some month when everyone will be 60 and nothing else to do than farm materials I think it will be harder to make money."
"As far as I understand it, you won't lose the house but you will no longer gain the benefits that come with owning the house. I.e trophies, free recall and so on.

I personally don't think the house tax is a bad idea as it's one of the only ways people spend gold at the moment 😂 

If you play regularly I think it's worth owning a house for extra storage and bonuses but it's all down to personal preference I suppose. At least you can decorate your house and enjoy housing crafting if it's you thing."
"Some mining gear, mining food & 1 run around everfall(newworld-map.com) will give you so much iron, that you'll have coin for 2weeks of taxes."
"> Will I lose my house if I cant afford taxes?

No. You only lose 3 of the housing features:

1. Fast travel to your home.

2. Global bonuses from the trophies placed in your home.

3. Ability to decorate your home and receive storage chest bonuses.


Housing isn't a casual-friendly feature. (Oh, the irony. LMAO)"
"The problem is that the companies with the relevant settlements (usually everfall, windsward and maybe blightwood) are walking around with jeff bezos money while companies only holding one of the other zones can't keep up with upkeep with tax income"
"I own the T3 house right next to the storage, smelter, tannery and lumber stations, its very convenient.  Taxes are low, and its a great location.  Yet still I'm the only person on my server that owns my house.   Sure its an ugly town but its one of the best home locations in the game.   I guess people care more about how it looks then its utility."
Have you seen the tax rate in Everfall? I'd never be able to afford a house solo!
"This should be upvoted. The initial 50% off applies to the initial PURCHASE PRICE of your first house. The taxes due beginning of the following week are full price, affected by only faction and company tax rate as well as any ""reduce tax rate"" standing gain bonuses you have chosen. 

Many people misunderstanding and thinking their tax rate will be 50% off as well."
Yeah you just don't have access to the bonuses of the house like fast travel and storage from chests. That's why I'm really confused how this happened because even if I just didn't pay the taxes I should still have the house.
I paid the taxes and pressed L to exit the house like always. I don't even know how you abandon the houses.
It wasnt even random keys all I pressed was N to bring up the taxes screen and L to exit after I paid the taxes
They are taxed based on how upgraded the stations are if I recall correctly.
"Eh not really, its the numbers that are busted rn. Nothing about ""sticking around and fixing things up"" is going to change the fact that you barely make anything in taxes when you own say, Restless Shores, and that no one buys a house there or trades there, etc etc. 

It truely is the design that is at fault. Ww and everfall will always make money and be warred on while other towns will be ignored."
The fast travel Cooldown can be reset with Azoth and is hugely discounted compared to regular fast travel (especially being 1000lbs full of materials).  You're trading gold for time. Definitely worth the purchase. Remember to lower taxes as you gain renown in that territory any time you can.
"Depends. I would buy after checking 3 points:

1. Do I need to fast travel a lot more than I can generate azoth?
2. Do I play the time per day to justify the tax (or do I pay tax just for weekends)?
3. Can I get trophies and chests without loosing all my money?

And after that I would think about the tier.
T1/2 would be sufficient for most players."
"Yes, keeping in mind you dont have to pay taxes and it will only temporarily disable your house until you pay them again. My house gives me gathering luck and more than 1000lbs extra storage."
"I think it’s funny that Amazon Games took what is generally one of the most casual elements of any MMO (player housing) and made it one of the most casual unfriendly features in the game. 

But yeah, get at least one cheap house somewhere and grind enough gold out each week to pay the taxes.  You almost have to at this point."
"Taking 4 or 5 territories then raising the taxes really helped your case for why people shouldn't dislike your company..... do you, but stop playing the victim when you're just as much to blame for the server dying as purple is lol. The server will be merged before too long, enjoy dominating while you can. Nothing against anyone on the server, but, we can all agree it's a shit show."
"Same thing on mine, though probably not the biggest company. Maxed all the taxes in their territories for a couple days, took it all and bailed."
I literally only realized yesterday how absurd the tax on converting components is.. I never looked at it before but yesterday I quickly glanced at the tax just before clicking craft and i'm pretty sure i saw 400 or 100 im not sure.. either way its kinda ridiculous and I can't believe I've unknowingly been spending this much gold on conversion. I think I would've been better off actually purchasing those 450 sandpapers off the market.
Wait until the quest dry up and a few rounds of repair and taxes hit
"I agree, but it's not without a cost. Repair bills are through the roof. Save on azoth by stashing your stuff at storages in the nearest city. I have a house in everfall (taxes suck) and put my inn at shattered mountain. That gets me pretty close to the areas I go to the most. I will most likely get 1 more house in MD and should be fine."
"Oi, you got a license for that tax?!"
"My dude. I own a house. I pay taxes. I know how they work. I pay a very very small small % of the price of the house in taxes... Do you even own a house to understand how your comparison fails? What part of what I said failed to register? lol

I spend 10k for a house and spend 1k in taxes. In 10 days I have the price of the house. 

I did not buy the house. I rented it. In that case why the initial 10k? Lets just change the names of things. We did not 'buy' a house. We 'rented' a house."
A living tax….. like pay gold to spawn or start over.
That is because taxes. It makes sense. That is why there are house recalls and inn recalls. You need to use them strategically.
The rune cost 3000 faction tokens and 500 gold for the T2 iron storage chest. The rune for T3 (starmetal chest) is 1000 gold. I make about 10-15 a day and sell them for 1400-2000 according to the market. That's roughly 600-1200g profit for each chest after tax (if I buy all components off the AH).
Highest earning territory is WW and they make about 130k per period with average taxes
"> -artificially pumping tax revenue by listing an item and receiving more tax money back than appropriate

Wait what?"
"On my server most basic resources have healthy price compared to how much gold you get after 60.

None go for 0.01 if your server has less players it means more noes available. And people cant farm more than 1-2 k gold per hour on an upper end after 60.

With all the other taxes and repairs it leaves little gold to buy things off market..."
so you can get nice and ready to be fucked by the tax system
cheers man I'll take a look. This should take care of the stupid house tax :)
"heeeeey, the solution to paying my house tax off, Yayyy! :'D"
it's all fun and games till u start paying your taxes ..
"The Amazon way pay no taxes.

https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/amazon-seattle-repeal-head-tax-homelessness"
Taxes are just a part of the policy issues..
"It was sort of a taxes bug, when it lied to us about having to pay less taxes."
"Cheaper in repair parts maybe, but definitely not in gold cost... It can cost anywhere from 100-500g to repair with parts (some have even said more), repair kits are not supposed to use gold to repair at all (except the like 0.5g crafting tax)"
Doesn't each applicable State [US] collect sales tax from online Amazon purchases? OP's idea almost makes too much sense
"I kind of agree. I think other games use it as a money sink, but with expensive housing rent, territory upkeep, and taxes for stuff other than the trading post, they aready got that."
Trading tax?
Probably settlement taxes aren't shown
"If they really have accurate information about golds they would have refunded exact taxes for the house a week ago instead of a flat 2k.

They have no idea."
"Not sure if memeing or something I have yet to receive but either way. Money making in this game feels horrible that I have come close to just play ironman. Self sufficient, grind every resource myself and the money I do make go well, into my house tax"
"Definitely not happy that I have taxes on two houses but AH is shut down. Also pretty damn sure I didn't get my 2K for the 4 bags that sold while I was offline last nite. I would have noticed my balance going up by 2K. And of course, tax on one house was due today and the other in the morning. GRRRR!"
"No,  I live in Canada. That's the after tax price here"
Trade disabled but ags still demands taxes. I also quit for a while. It is a shitshow.
Yep i post things at weavers fen cuz i save 30 percent on taxes cuz my company holds it. Ppl only go there to buy 500+ gold things tho since anything cheaper theyd just stay at ww.
"Same here, I also got banned yesterday for ""cheating"", I made several (5-6) characters on different EU servers to check the map/taxes and chat.. I was also banned later yesterday evening. My brother only made 3 characters and didn't get banned.."
"checking map distribution, tax rates in town and getting a feel for how the chat is there for starters."
Don’t pay the tax if the controlling faction raises taxes. Don’t live in Austin if you can’t afford the rent.
"Lol town boards? Not on my server. That would require a company that isn't just a parasite, leeching taxes and giving nothing back"
"Hmmm… I don’t mind grinding and farming, but I don’t even own one house because I’m too afraid I won’t be able to pay the tax.  That does sound like a headache and the longer way to go…"
Id rather pay a premium than give any tax money to the worst of the servers enemies
"And they cost a huuuge tax to use, only worth it in very select scenarios, not just globally good."
"Not buying...  Yet.

Sitting on 100k but I got taxes to pay, cant be dropping my whole wad on some voidbent yet"
I can attest that on smaller servers it is often just one or a couple players throwing down 10k. I really just think that those costs should be adjusted to playerbase and taxes earned or something.
Does not paying housing tax have the same effect? Abandoning a house would feel bad unless absolutely necessary
I am purple and yes i noticed taxes but many others do it you cant do anything about it its in game mechanic.
"Are you trying to pay remotely?

If you are doing it remotely then your standing property tax reduction does not apply. I'm not sure if you need to just be in the territory or not, but going to the house to pay will give you the correct standing discount."
"I have the same issues it feels like the perks dont even work with the property tax reduction. I got off today because I spent hours farming mats, sold it in the Trading post and got 0 gold back. Need a break from this game"
10% housing tax? Time to revolt
"Still a risky game, I know two guys who transfered to my server that peaks at 800 . Things were fine but one day some tax drama happened and almost all of yellow left leaving us at a peak of 300ish. Purple now has control of the map but still are pushing high taxes. We have no t5 crafting benches anywhere for almost 3 days now. This server is now doomed to die and those guys are stuck here."
I cannot afford repairs or crafting fees or house taxes at 60
"My company owned Everfall during the tax bug, they reimbursed us 10k Gold. We easily lost 500k-1m in taxes. Customer support is asking pc specs and log files..."
"Yeah, like an idiot I placed sell orders last night after TP came back online, so I'll probably lose those fees too now.

Probably going to just fill buy orders or not sell at all for a few days if it goes down/up again.

Tax man is becoming the final boss in this game."
"It's not a bad game design, it's designed with the incentive of pvp don't like the tax well claim the territory and lower it."
I don't get how anyone can play this game and disagree with this.  The tax system is obviously a huge part of the game and ties into controlling and owning territories... It creates drama. It adds to the MMO feeling. It's actually really cool
"There's a delicate balance between too much and too little. Too much taxes, and no one will want to go there. Therefore they generate no income, and the settlement becomes shit."
"Yup. And the existence of that balance is a feature not a flaw IMO. It creates emergent gameplay and creates changing incentives to player behaviors. Taxes too high? Maybe you form an alliance with another company/faction to boycot EF. Taxes just fine? Maybe you backstab your allies 😈

The drama is the gameplay imo."
"The high end crafts are more worth it than they were before, but still not comparatively worth it in time and cost as the lower tier items. The variety of resources to gather, the refining tax, the cost in refining agents, etc. the exp of higher tier crafts needs to further be increased."
"Okay, that is horrible and hilarious.  I have to call out this gem though ""All taxes are being paid to the settlement at which a contract is listed"".

Like, this was a big piece of the update they talked about.   How was that not caught in any testing?  That should have been such an easy and obvious piece to test.  I can sort of understand some defects where it is a specific combination of actions that cause a defect, but this one is so obvious."
"Nah man, gota tax him further to get the back pay for that extra room."
"so if someone paid a tax on their houses, he has to pay it again? :-)"
"My server went down just now unexpectedly but not before 6 invasions turned a bunch of cities into rubble and all taxes were due despite being paid yesterday.

Do they not have some kind of graceful shutdown procedure for their servers or do they just wrap the power cord around their wrists and yank?"
I'm on Adiri too. I had to pay taxes for the same house 3 times yesterday (1 legit and 2 from server crashing/time skipping).
"Reduced property taxes, better gathering yield, lower crafting fees, more storage, etc. I still do some town board quests to get more territory standing levels for those perks."
At least in TF 2 you got a chance to win Australium weapons (gold) skins of the original weapons. They sold for ridiculous amounts of money. I must of made like around 800 bucks selling those things. Had to fill out tax info in order to keep using the market.
"How does this help with the duping in any way? 

Weird expiration by the devs here. Pretty sure saving housing tax for a few weeks doesn't change anything about dupers"
They did this because of the 90% housing tax currently going on
That’s not even how companies are compensated for taxes. It’s not 1:1 and never has been. A large portion is just deleted
"Advice, treat your territory as a way to get marketplace trades with minimal tax.

Fraction of tax money goes to guild wallet. Just take the tax as donation to guild. You still buy goods with marginally cheaper rates.

Other than that, nope. No impression of higher trade tax than usual from Cutlass. Its mostly our own guild members utilizing it that shows as a small bump.  


Doesn't help that cutlass is a bum ass zone that no one goes to, except to farm the iron + silver nodes nearby"
"I think they need to have bulk orders

So I should be able to list a group of items sold for a single price 

I also think they should remove listing fees.in exchange for taxes paid on sale 

Make a trading skill or something that increases number of orders you can have listed"
Why is it a bad idea? Who else should do it? Amazon? A Bot? No taxes?
"Each day, go and do 3 daily faction PvE quests. The first 3 give you 10x the gold. Depending on your level and quest, that’s 2-600 gold a day, just for doing 3 dailies. I pay my house tax and some by just doing this with little interaction with a trading post."
Yeah they only reason they bought them is because of the reduced taxes but it's meaningless if they don't get the perks.  At least they get the extra recall point since they always run out of Azoth and I'm fine since I have had a house forever to recall to for free/cheap.
Could be a Ui bug not reflecting a difference in taxs
"You have probably been mass reported by those angry players.

Bonus point if a GM was part of those angry players.

So yes you got banned for raising taxes, not directly by the game, but by the angry mob."
"Yeah. I think the annoying part in this case is it was unplanned and impromptu. Plus everyone hates our company because they max taxed. But we give funds to help our faction claim other territories. 

In regards to those level 50s you know they didn't have any work to worry about to be able to get that far, and forgets that not everyone else has the opportunity to request off. I don't mind tryharding to an extent, but... I don't know i feel like there's a right way and a wrong way."
"I mean the absence of money means we wouldn't be on this sub as this game and it's concept wouldn't exist in the first place. Even the joke is poor cause once you took over you would institute your own taxes. 

Commies are just articulate flat earthers/anti vaxxers change my mind.

I'll have a check for a well run democratic capitalism with a robust welfare state please"
"Giving bans in a pvp game where words are offensive but killing each other/stealing from each other/ forcibly taxing each other is a ok.
What a weak world we live in."
Yea but the weekly prop tax is like 700$ on that one
mayebe additional tax from terriyory owners?
"I thought about that, the trading tax in windsward is set at 12.99% for the territory owners. If you divide the additional 1.22 gold by 0.1299 it comes out at 9.4ish gold. So we are working out 12.99% of 9.4 and adding it on, I can't see where this 9.4 gold comes from, or why we are paying the trading tax on it. 

Also when testing I found we pay the full 12.99% trading tax when listing an item - so all 12.99% is accounted for, so why are buyers paying a 12.99% fee for buying as well?"
Im talking specifically about getting taxed on both ends. Id assume the extra money just gets deleted essentially.
Challenge guild leader to a 1v1 to reduce taxes? Hahah
"They should also offer some type of delivery system from the other towns for an added fee and tax, maybe call it AGS Prime"
Cheap houses have cheap tax
"It's totally true. The tool tip tells you what the property tax is. Unless the in game menu is incorrect, which, in hindsight now, could totally be the case."
"Mobs give gold, salvaging gear gives gold, other players questing generates gold. Hell, wars give a ton of gold,, which means 100 players get a fat payout. Money shifting from A to B is how you manage WAY more than 2k per week. The generation of gold is far from slow, but it's also not difficult to accumulate what you need to pay those taxes. 

That said, frick high tax rates. Nobody likes high tax rates."
"oh btw you might want to know that depending on the house the property tax could also be 250 g per week, it all depends on the house and the tax set by the company"
Ya agreed I think my and my friends are going to wait and see sequisha Leaves. If not we may bounce because yellow is just going to keep controlling everything and eventually they can just raise taxes. I’m just going to remain hopeful that it will balance out but We will see. I know we lost monarch today. I’m not sure what else.
"Yes and yes. Tax every week.
If you don’t pay you still keep your house but don’t get the bonuses until you pay again"
"Because the same people won't take the same stance when it's people making 30k ""not paying taxes""."
"I've said it once and I'll say it again....killing people, force taxing people, and stealing from people is ok but the silly words from complete strangers is where they draw the line. Makes 0 sense and just caters to the weak minded people who shouldn't be playing anyways."
"I guess so. I've put a few on the marketplace now and a few I'm trying to sell without taxes. The 10% of big cities just eats into profits so much + the posting fee for items like this makes it expensive in case you don't sell it,"
"Pc gamers love to gatekeep ""old cards"" new world is definitely a taxing game but 980 is still capable just need to mess with settings and figure out the fan problem haha."
"Yes, you can travel as soon as the popup appears which tells you the tax rates etc."
Gotta dodge as many taxes as possible
"I find it funny that by not paying the tax you can't decorate. What are they going to do, bolt my existing furniture to the ground and have someone posted inside to confiscate the new rug I want to put down lol"
Could it be a bug? Read on wiki that first time owners also have discount on taxes
"I can't pay the tax yet, takes a week, but the tax is not halved per the payment graphic.

It was halved before I purchased it."
"My taxes first week are 836 gold right now. 500 base, I've got some discounts from territory standing + whatever I'm paying in taxes. 

I've been told first house bonus only lasts one week, at which point my base tax rate should go up to 1000. I can't confirm that yet though, as I just bought my house today."
"I just bought the 7500 gold house (so 15k), and when I bought it it said taxes are 350, but after buying it it shows 750. Taxes in the town are 5% so clearly the taxes I'm being charged do not reflect the 50% discount I'm supposed to get."
So what are the payments that happen?  Does the owning company have to pay upkeep and require taxes to help pay it?  I have no idea how it works so I just imagine if I owned a place I'd set the taxes very low so everybody is happy.
Yup I'm in the Marauders who have assaulted them twice.  Damn offense is hard though.  No one in our server has won on offense yet but that tax hike they did sealed my disdain for them
"Why is it always Everfall that gets hit with this haha

To be fair in my server it was the Australian Tax Office that took the region, so I guess we should have expected they'd hike taxes"
"See, I could understand that if was how it worked. Another faction got the town, now they max taxes for it for a 3 day period and the Company keeps those earnings, but then needs to build up the town with it afterwords.  

But I'm the same faction as this company.... its just greed to me."
"I mean the benefit from the houses generally outweigh the tax. And I don't believe you have to pay tax, you just lose trophy buffs and some other stuffs if you don't."
How much are the upkeep costs on a house.  Nervous about buying one and then being bled dry by upkeep / taxes or whatever
"I've not bought any houses yet because of the cost in taxes, but I think I will now that the comments are suggesting to."
What if New World IS the island to avoid paying taxes to the Old World!?
Just put a progressive system on it. 15% tax on your first million. 30% on anything above that. That alone would probably double our governments tax revenue haha
"I grind the mats and azoth, dump all my azoth into crafting. I post my tools/offer my furnishing service in global. I'll even deliver the tools if needed. Usually chill in the workshop or chop wood outside monarch.

Edit: I do global to reach more people and I can't offer furnishing services in the market. Plus it's tax free for both parties."
"Yep, I grinded Windsward’s standing to lv35, but they raised the tax, crafting fee and trading fee, so it’s a big turn off."
I believe so also don't forget you can pick to reduce property tax in the territory standing reward selection screen.
"A lot of items are garbage and not worth keeping. Stuff which sells for under 0.1 you can safely toss. If you need them just buy them back from the market

This game encourages you not to hoard and specialize. Hoarding is expensive... taxes on a t4 house are no joke just for the extra storage"
Piggybacking off this. What level in your Territory rewards do you get a reduce property tax option- if you even get one or is that just tied to faction? Im very close to getting A t4 house but i been saving some perks in case there are some options that are retroactive.
"There are property tax reduction cards, at 30 I have 19.1% reduction to it.

I have been trying to take everyone I could get my hands on."
"I like it too! Bought one as soon as i could. It's definitely not for everyone. I personally won't buy a tier 4 house (yet) just because of the price of taxes. Late game? Shit, I'll own a lot of property."
What OP doesn’t tell you is that yellows use to own the whole map and jacked taxes to extreme levels. 🤡
"Yeah I saw a guild leader of Windsward selling Orichalcum tools in chat. Level 42. 

Can the guy just take the taxes and buy the mats? Not sure. Or he was funneled?

&#x200B;

I'm doing engineering atm 146. I run in a circle around a wolves caves outside of Everfall for Iron, Wood and Rawhide. And craft Speers. So i have the t5 tools to grind more. Haha"
Or even back taxes after you stop paying. It's nice.
"Our server was kind of like this but opposite, first few days a company screwed our progress by stealing money/hiking taxes etc so syndicate only held 1 territory while g/y held 4/5. A few key leaders of our faction popped up and now we hold 3 territories. Issue is we still have two large companies in our faction that want to work “independently” of the whole faction and actively trash on others trying to work together."
"Yea I'm looking forward to when I get enough funds going for housing and the taxes associated with it, but honestly it seems like a money sink for me at this point of the game. 

My buddy just saved for the most expensive house and didn't read enough to understand how the taxes work, so now he's blown his whole gold pouch and trying to get ahead of the taxes in that settlement for the weekly cost."
"I've got one tier 2 And one tier 3 home. Taxes haven't been bad but I'm also taking in the gold with crafting.

If you're not playing the market and just want it for convenience it's going to bankrupt you fast."
"Yes, it's the half off for the first house. And I just paid my first set of taxes today, the upcoming pay period had the exact same tax rate."
But paying double house tax meaning your second t4 house is roughly minimum 2k per week ?
"Those numbers aren't adding up, are you sure prior to purchase it shows 850 for taxes? If your faction owns the territory, you get an additional discount, however my faction doesn't own any territories on my server, so I haven't had a chance to determine how it works."
Thank you OP! I play this game to avoid real life and the tax talk made me shook
"There's some confusion right now, it's possible that my explanation here was wrong, so I'm going to give you two different possibilities. 

The first is that you'd follow the method I listed here, and you'd expect to pay 1,540 gold per pay period. 

The second is that the dynamic tax rate is all that's considered, and you'd be expected to pay 3000 per pay period, or 1500 if the discount is applied properly. Based on feedback from other people, I'm leaning towards the 3000 per pay period."
"except there are many ways to remove their control

declare a war on their settlement or take over another settlement and stop letting them profit on your taxes if u believe this is whats happening as controlling settlements is a major part of the game and is one of the biggest aspects of the game"
I think it's not a exploit. It's a game choice and since you still pay tax I don't see a problem with it.
"Honestly, I have no idea. I guess my brain just through regular weekly(ish) payment for your house and jumped straight to rent.

You're right though. In-game it's called tax. I've changed it on my sheet now, thanks."
"I don't know how more people didn't see the complete failure of the games economy coming, guess people hadn't hit 60 when this was posted. There is basically no late game source of gold income, and what is there is completely offset by every single system in the game being taxed."
The tax discount is only valid for the first week.
"Why is there even so much tax. I payed 20k for my house already. Why do I have to pay 1k extra every 5 days when there's no reliable ray to get gold. Sure u can sell stud but where is all this gold coming from, other then from quests. Everything has crashed Soo much. I feel there needs to be some from of gold income."
"all taxes go to company, companies spend that gold to upgrade crafting stations and declare wars"
Listing fees and taxes don’t go to the player
"Nah, not easy to exploit at all. You jack up taxes and people will go to another town to craft and trade. Then all your stations degrade and no one comes back."
Iron ingots was making me money prices dropped massively last few days though from around 1.70 to 0.80 and looks like  still dropping.  I’m sittting around 18k gold now wasted 10k on a tier four house wish I didn’t bother as taxes ridicules for it.
"We always own Windsward. We could fight for more, but as a company we have decided to make Windsward a full year 5 crafting hub. We have lower taxes and higher tier crafting tables. I'd suggest giving that a shot."
"next time you get into game, before you click continue to log in, got to upper right corner and open the game settings and take pictures of your games settings.

see the shadow, water, fps cap and all that jazz. it may help someone to troubleshoot you further, also do the same for your nvidia control panel. 

&#x200B;

FWIW, i set low to shadows and water and nameplates to 25 even though i have a pretty good hardware set up, just less taxing on resources."
I don’t think taxes as what caused that. It sounds like a bug or maybe something else happened
It’s a common mistake to think you see an extra 0 somewhere but it’s alright man. What’s the tax rate for you in there?
T4 house tax so expensive
"Doesn’t really work in NW unless you are the absolute first in that niche, which at 2 weeks in, is kind of impossible. Profit margins that are too small also just suck because of tax and the risk of not selling/prices falling"
"Also, it adds more value to owning a house & paying its taxes. 

It also adds more functions to the decorations we put in like the storage chest."
"Well my company is hopefully taking the town back in a war tonight so that impacts my decision as well, I definitely get the benefits but I’m still working through the msq and can just go a week without it and save 1000.  I also read somewhere that paying taxes from the map is bugged and isn’t giving the rep discount"
10% governer set tax + 5% default/server tax = 15% x 6 taxes/month (every 5 days) = 90% / month
"make sure u set the selling time for 1 day or such to reduce the fees and take the territory perk to reduce taxes

or take over a settlement to avoid taxes or use the neutral settlements if taxes are very high"
"Similar story on my server. Cov took it, raises taxes to extreme (hence Evertax), but nobody has succeeded to take it. In fact, the company who owns Everfall have not lost a single defensive war since release.

Taxes are now moderate, but Everfall is either referred to as Evertax or Neverfall."
"Lots of companies are gouging property tax at 20% in everfall, feel like it's going to be the norm."
"Oh I see, my mistake, thought you meant the minor ones. It’s really hard to say, I can’t imagine anyone paying up to 5k for a trophy. Then again, some people might. Maybe try posting in the chat instead of the market to avoid exorbitant taxes?"
My tax is 2k bro. 800 is nothing
Your areas property tax is damn high.. my 2.5k house (that i bought w 5k) only has 250 gold tax.
"first week tax is supposed to be half off

but like most things ""late game"" its bugged and you dont get the discount"
"Theres a whole heap of problems with endgame crafting, gold scarcity, and property taxes. 

I like the crafting system in this game a lot though. My biggest problem with it is the exponential need for low tier resources as you craft higher tier items. It doesnt even make sense. Why would you make a stronger metal weaker by adding lower quality and hardness metals to it? Why need iron for starmetal? Lolz"
Are you the tax man? Lol
Tips I want is how can you afford it and the tax. If the answer is “play TP” then please elaborate because economy went to shit quickly.
"The TP only moves Gold (AND removes with Tax). Imagine all the players on your world getting to level 60 and having done all the quests, leaving no to too few gold to generate all the while gold sinks (crafting, repairing, taxes, respeccing, trading, house tax removes gold permanently) so no that isn't the solution. I'm only level 43 and even i understand this."
"The purchase cost is a sink, the taxes go to the company, which is also a partial sink due to town costs. The entire system funnels gold from the players into the hands of a select fee companies, and only some of those companies are actually banking anything notable from the towns."
"My server drama right now:

1 guild mad people refuse to flag for pvp.(consistently runs as a 20+ squad around a streamer)

proceed to take over entire server and max a lot of taxes.

Copium in global that at least people might flag for pvp now.

players starts to swap to their faction for lower costs of travel.

whine about flavor of the month swappers."
First person to make it to 60 without paying a dime of taxes gets to go on the next rocket ride with Bezos
"Same on my server. All red taxes and not a single station over t3, it’s a joke"
It's funny how this game so casually proves the point that lowering taxes can actually result in increased revenue.
Wait you can opt out of paying the property tax??
Unfortunately one of the guilds owns all of the sub 30 towns and has their taxes all set to max. It's disheartening as someone that's not trying to hit max level asap.
"This is my server.
The Sikinti company is a subcompany of another company called Mezu. Between Mezu, Sikinti, and another of their subcompanies, they own all but 4 territories on the map, so they just whacked up the tax rates across the board."
Everyone can't cut each others hair and pay tax forever. Gold needs to enter the game to keep the economy healthy. You are completely missing the point of this thread.
"I'm making gold selling iron and stuff, but what I'm doing is taking other people money, that money is shrinking by each trade you make, every tax you pay, every time you fix you gear, etc.

Suppose that there is 5 million gold in the server today, players sink 150k into the system and the system gives back 100k in missions, monster killed and scrapping, tomorrow will be 4.95 million gold, and each day will be less."
Have you seen how much a company has to pay taxes to own the territory?
"Perhaps you should be allowed to buy a house everywhere, but only have 3 active at one time. Like if you let your taxes lapse, you can start using some other location."
"ok lol

for the normal player, the taxes are insane"
"And keep paying crazy taxes in about everything, plus no storage link thus adding more wasted time traveling, spending even more Azoth for fast travel if territories dont change hands? (always walking/running got pointlessly time consuming and tedious already) Thanks but no thanks."
"They could make company storage or guild hall a purchasable building in a town. It gets taxed, is independent of town ownership, and is only accessed locally. It makes sense that companies will be ""based"" in towns and pay to whoever owns it."
Kinda have to with taxes though
"Is it easy for you to maintain 3 houses at level 60? With the economy where it is and all that, I feel like you’d have to play a ton to keep up with the weekly tax, but I’m not sure what farming gold is like at that level."
Yeah this comment sounds like a good solution until you realize there’s not a reliable or efficient way to farm coin to pay for your property taxes to own homes. The games economy is also an issue I have. Once Reddit hits level 60 they’ll likely echo these complaints in this subreddit. Pretty sick that you need a key to do pve content too.
"Need less gold sinks more low to mid tier resource sinks. Right now EVERYTHING sinks gold, repairs, houses, taxes for houses, taxes for crafting, trading, upgrading settlements, declaring wars, buying settlements. It's kind of out of control how much gold sinks this game has while only providing one guaranteed way to make gold(questing) that eventually runs out."
I saved up 22k for a big house in everfall but im really thinking about getting a cheaper one. If things stay as they are I'd go with the cheaper one for sure but i think they'll add some sort of gold influx with the outpost rushes or whatever else. And theres a big difference if the weekly tax is 30m of farming or 2 hours.
"From what I understand, you can keep your house but lose the perks until you pay the taxes for that week you’re currently on. And If it’s worth it for you? All depends if you can afford the gold and need the perks I’d say 😂"
"I strongly believe even a casual player could pay taxes on one house weekly. 

If you take a cheaper house it’s very easy.

Even for the expensive houses it’s only 10ish end game quests every 5 days to pay taxes. Each quest takes around 20 minutes, so you just need to dedicate 1-2 hours per 5 days to getting gold."
"Even though you ""save"" 10k - 50% off the 20k purchase price - you're still paying an extra 7.5k upfront for 3 extra storage slots you still have to buy chests for. The fast travel cooldown timer always costs 50 azoth to reduce from max regardless of house tier, so you save a little bit of azoth there as well but not a lot. Then taxes are going to be ballpark 1k instead of 250g every five days to maintain those marginal benefits. T4 house makes sense sometimes but it's hardly a noob trap."
"With home prices, tax, repairing, et cetera set outside the player economy, and draining gold from the player economy, there needs to be a gold influx to offset that to some degree. I would argue that it's probably fine at the current rate, but it could collapse after the majority player base runs out of main/side quests to do. I donno."
"My faction is about even with a 4/4/3 split.

I, however, don't go to any of the zones my faction owns.

Fucking purples and their taxes."
"What do you mean by ""The max tax revenue a company can make on a city is 100k""?

On our server Windsward and Everfall made over 170k in taxes in the past 4 days?"
Death. Taxes. People bitching about maintenance windows.
"People are making money and being smart, just stop being salty over missing out, anyone can figure out you make money if you buy 20-30k pure solvent for 0.01-0.05 even after faction conversion crafting tax.

Play smart, get ahead."
"The recent patch told us it wasn't a bug of the discount not applying, *it's a bug of the UI* because apparently there aren't supposed to be tax discounts."
what's even more awesome is that if your faction doesn't control the zone you get NO discount for your standing cards in that zone anymore. it just goes immediately to the max tax rate. good times.
"many guides say so. that if you dont pay taxes you cant port, cant use trophies and cant decorate but storage works.

but thats wrong. nothing works if you dont pay taxes. i tested it. when the timer is up, i lose my extra storage space as well. until i pay."
Not violent crime but if they legalized all drugs it would save tens of billions of dollars every year in tax money and crime would plummet across the board in all areas.
You don't lose your house if you don't pay the taxes do you? I thought you just lost the perks of home ownership of trophies and such
"It’s a good thing.  People need to understand this.  It’s jump started the economy as it’s increased the velocity of gold on the servers.  Go read about money velocity.  

People are crafting again, big time, and selling and buying.  Trade is up.  That means more taxes for companies, crafters can sell useful items because there are buyers etc.  

Reagents were clearly a bottle neck.  This is a good move."
The problem is the way taxes work if something is only worth .01 your better off throwing it on the ground unless you know you can sell a few thousand of them. Then if only 500 sell you lost gold in the transaction as the seller.
I'm level 37 and to be honest I haven't felt the need to buy a house at all because I'm not willing to pay the taxes on it.
"1. Level up the bonus for reduced property tax
2. Ask to join the controlling company really quickly to get 2000 gold off of the t4 price."
All I’m saying is you can boycott the town without much loss. Resume your crafting shenanigans once new ownership and taxes and in place.
As a casual I have 0 interest in fighting your wars or defending your settlement from an invasion. I will PVP quest to help counter an opposing faction trying to take your territory IF your taxes are fair. If not they can have it. I also enjoy helping companies take territories by running PVP quests. All of these are for selfish reasons though.
"I don’t understand why there isn’t just a default percentage tax taken from the direct income. Then you NEVER have to worry about balancing income/production, it balances itself."
The current taxes and upkeep were never adjusted after they nerfed townboards and fishing and portals gold.  Simple fix is actually adjust those costs to be in line with reasonable gold generation
It is if you can afford it.  If paying taxes is really going to cramp your game play than no.  You can live without it.  I enjoy mine though leveling furnishing is hell.
"My taxes, with my housing tax discounts, are roughly $700 a week!"
Yea but I’d argue that doesn’t matter your Matts if prices reasonably on the market we’re gonna sell anyway…. Now If you post a 50k listing for something worth 2g than you deserve a ban. Because why else pay the tax besides your getting duped gold
"I’ve had a T2 house since week 1 with zero regrets, in fact, I’m considering buying a second t1 house soon for additional trophy buffs.

Taxes are a non issue, I easily make enough to cover my T2 house taxed at 10% rate by just playing the game.   In fact, I’ve paid taxes 3 times now since I bought the house and every week I have way more than I did the week before."
On the server I am on it was the governor that drained over 125k gold from their companies bank raise the taxes. Then put some random person in charge of their company. Then transfered servers leave over 45+ people on the server. What even weirder yet is they owned 2 settlement. They pissed off a lot of greens when they did it.
"When duped gold goes through trading post, crafting, taxes and everything: how are you going to remove it from the game? How are you supposed to fix dupe's impact on the economy if some people have already used it to max out all of their crafting professions? 

There has to be a rollback."
Then you have to deal with the abnormally high taxes on conversions
Or they'll put up with the TP taxes and launder the gold to a higher level toon.
TP taxes ?
Trading Post transactions are taxed by the town the trading post is in. But unless you're going to level gate trading post usage you could use outrageously priced sell orders to launder gold from a farming bot to a higher level character.
"I have the following bonuses:

1. Crafting Fee - 23.6%
2. Trading Tax - 25.4%
3. Property Tax - 33.9%
4. Gathering speed - 32.8%
5. Storage - 275 
6. House items - 15 extra items
7. Faction Tokens - 16.3%
8. House Ownership
9. Standing Gain - 30.5%"
Jeff: “What do you mean? I don’t recognise the name at all. Tax isn’t a random string of letters?”
"Some real life fun info - I just calculated my property tax on my apartment.
It would take north of 6000 YEARS to pay my apt value just in property taxes."
I just calculated the time in where I would pay my apt value in my property taxes… it’s north of 6 000 years.
"This is the most bizarre argument to me.

Housing taxes aren't fun. There's no in-game need for them with instanced housing. There are plenty of other gold sinks, and this is an unpleasant one.

This argument is like ""You do know when you die in real life you don't come back to life, right? It's not like when you get hit by a car you just wake up back at your home totally healthy. Obviously game should have permadeath."""
"The tax reductions are multiplicative, not additive. Also, the tax decreases you get from territory standings, and all territory standing buffs for that matter, have diminishing returns. So you will never get to exactly zero property tax (unless there's some kind of bug or exploit I'm not aware of) but with max territory standing, low taxes, and all the faction/company buffs, you could potentially turn that cost into something pretty negligible."
Level your territory standing and upgrade your reduced property tax bonuses. At level 42 territory standing I have 29.5% reduced property tax and only have to pay 1k gold a week for my t4. That's just doing 3 faction missions each day for 3 days.
Are cities make about 120k gold profit per week. Which isn't great but it's enough for us to upgrade them the best we can. I don't take any money from the treasury. All the money from taxes is put back into the city.
If you don’t pay rent/taxes an NPC appears and takes random items from your inventory
"A mega company started using exploits on wars, took all the territories bar 2 and everything they took over they put all taxes to maximum. The server is dying now and once transfers are back, will be dead."
"I'm 400 hours in without a house and I have no plans to subscribe to this tax scam now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwPg8gJq_Kw"
"I currently have about 40k so I’m not too worried about being able to pay my taxes in the time I would be playing. Also, with no back taxes, if I’m truly poor I can just not pay and I’ll still be better off in the long term. Those trophies and the Azoth saved are worth it IMO."
Gather speed is useless. Tools gives you 600 speed when town gives about 35. better use for storage and taxes
"not really..  
There's deflation because of gold farming.

People are selling mats for low prices because they need gold to pay taxes/repairs. 

If everyone had plenty of gold, those materials would probably be bought all from the market to level up crafts and townboards. And the prices would rise, since most people are lazy to gather."
"which, you'd think people wouldn't, but with the prices going up people must be.

I would assume people are also buying purely cause Tax system sucks and coins are related to basically everything you do in this game"
"The green on my server have become screwed over, one company in our faction had 4 zones, and they were all supposedly gold sellers anyway, but they moved servers when they found out about the infinite gold glitch, and upped all the taxes to max before they left. The server is now mostly purple, nobody could defend the zones in a war."
"The money they get comes from taxes used at crafting/refining stations.  You can go into the main hall at any city and see the revenue they make. Do you realize how much gold it cost to upgrade from a tier 4 to a tier 5 tannery? If you dont like how a company is handling a city then its easy, dont use that city and dont give that company any more of your gold."
"^^ how to make x gold  in 2h..
But never mencion how much thei pay for max tier hause +, tax + trophy price ;D"
"It's an interesting give and take, and I think the politics of it all are fun to watch play out.  For example, we've definitely had high tax issues on our server on multiple occasions.  But, now we have one company, who owns first light, who makes it a point to say, as long as they own the territory, the taxes will remain lower than the rest of the server.  So far, they've kept to it.  I don't think anyone even wants to invade them now.  lol"
"I transferred off his server, half the time Everfall and Windsward were at max taxes, half the time average. At least this was up until the server transfer day."
I can’t wait to leave this server. We have under 100 cov and green just maxes taxes in any town we have had. It’s brutal lmao.
"Unless you hold the capital, it's not very profitable. Taxes are high and upgrading stations makes them higher. If all players treat 1 settlement as 'home' the others won't be taking in a lot of cash."
LPT: server transfer resets your tax status on your home
Yeah I havent really played the game in the last 3 days. I just log on to put shit on the marketplace and pay my taxes then parkour from roof to roof in the city im in for 30 min then log off.. Sometimes I do an invasion or a war for the rewards ofc. but thats very rare.
"Current faction/war system is useless.

You can increase taxes, steal castles. Buy hey we are in peace, and we are all friends. No sense at all"
That's from the patch from last night re: housing taxes! It should have been 2k gold.
So taxes just stack for every week you don't pay? How can I sell my houses before going to vacation lol
"No that's not a real thing. House taxes are like a prepaid phone. You buy the house and it comes with a free week. After that, you can recharge it only a weekly basis. If you don't pay by the time it runs out, you lose the benefits. At any point, you can buy another week and it starts working again. Anyone who tells you otherwise is completely misinformed."
"I had to sell 10k of my linens to store my iron ingots because I was out of fund to craft due to high taxes imposed by the governors.    

I blame the governors and their bureaucracy."
Property taxes work (as long as you ignore the fact they use a 5 day week for some unknown reason)
"I dk how taxes are for people without a faction, but  i doubt that you will craft for free. And you will lose much of the main story. Cause when you hit lvl 10 the main story requires you to join a faction."
"Still is, your territory discount doesn't apply unless you're in the territory. Never pay house tax unless you're already in the zone."
It's a life lesson to learn here. There is no such thing as *less taxes*. We should be grateful they teach us that
"I agree there's 3 starter zones, one faction should be default own a starter zone and new characters should start in their faction's starter zone.  All other territories should be fought over.  Sucks whichever faction gets appointed to first light but its better than current.  Faction's starter zone could be without a controlling company so it could default to lowest taxes for faction and neutral for other factions.  For the town board the players playing there could vote on what upgrades to work on."
"I'd love if company's could upgrade a wagon that gets sent from town to town.

You could load your banks content inside and send it to a different town for a fee.

Or use it as a taxi

Would be a nice tax revenue for town owners."
"yes we need more taxes ! house taxes , travel taxes , weight taxes , farming taxes , pvp taxes . TAXES !!!! i LOVE when i pay the taxes irl aswell ! ahh who doesnt like taxes ... <3"
"Offer to pay the difference between current taxes collected and upkeep taxes due.

Problem solved... oh wait you don't have 40k to spend a week? Too bad..."
You run the numbers and even with higher taxes you dont cover the costs in those towns. Add on top everyone leaves due to tax rates :/
"100%, and the top price for resetting that cooldown will always be 50 flat Azoth counting down according to how much cooldown is left on your recall.

Tier 2 house is plenty. 2 wooden chests is 400 extra lbs for your storage which was a lot for me, and I have the taxes under 500/wk.

Pick a place that doesn't change hands a lot if you can, I went with Cutlass Keys on my server."
Have you paid taxes on it? I haven't heard in any bugs like that.
"Compared that to paying listing fee over and over again and buying multiple house and more property tax. You seem to not handle large enough quantity of stuff too see the cost of storing high-value stuff on trade posts (along with possibility of it getting accidentally bought off). There is no extra work when I gather material on my travel anyway. Making use of available free space never harm anyone. If you don't offer any constructive criticism, I won't bother reply to you anymore."
"It's a tax, so you don't lose your house, but you are fucked."
"While in theory yes, this issue is I'm pretty sure most servers I've seen the stations are basically only in everfall and windsward because the entire market is in those two towns and the majority of the other cities can't upgrade because the lack of a viable market and taxes."
"What if I sold mats on AH (Mats purchased by duped gold) and used that money to pay my house taxes?  Any way to prove that the amount deposited from the AH was the amount I used to pay taxes?  There's a lot of untied issues you guys seem to not be thinking of.  This is a lot harder than Item A created, delete Item A."
">  So many people are unable to get money to pay for their taxes. 

Doesn't matter, you can't pay them anyways :)"
"Close, I am government worker, payed extra well for doing night-shifts at a prison, which means most of the workday zero shit happens. So, while being payed with (maybe your) taxes, I can just sit and post whatever while the long nights I am payed through roll on. 

Don't worry though, sometimes I read a book or patrol a block. Most likely the book. But reddit, discord and other social media keeps time rolling.

Glad to see you mad though! Made my night!"
It has the on my server due to faction drama which resulted in the taxes being maxed out.
"Maybe that's why Amazon turned off our pay taxes button, so everyday would just downgrade back into oblivion"
They need to lock the money that is donated into the treasury so it cannot be taken out. There is no reason governors or consuls should be able to take out tax money or donated money from their members and use that money on the auction house for their own gain. Make that money usable for wars and towns only!
"Patch last night turned them back on from what I heard. And you would think the amount is small for taxes, but if it’s 7% or higher for every action you take in a town, it adds up quick. Especially if they have the whole server paying these kind of taxes in Windsward or Everfall. They making bank before dipping."
does paying taxes give xp what!!
A company did this in everfall in my server. Totally fucked up the taxes. I just didn’t pay them and would get people riled up about the tax increase in global. Let them shit talk the company that owns it until they lower it. Could take a while but it works
Yeah and it wouldn't be so bad if they were not able to use in game systems like the property tax to really beat the fun out of the game.
I played on this server as a marauder in the dominant company and can say we never exploited. We lost Monarch Bluff and Brightwood because they abused the hatchet when it was broken. The company is transferring to another server and so they jacked up the taxes to try to get a bunch of gold to transfer with but it ended up backfiring. Lots of in fighting and players not using the territories. It is what it is.
Companies are also jacking taxes to the max and refusing to pay upkeep costs now so they transfer servers with absurd amounts of gold. It's far from just invasions causing things.
When housing is expensive and taxes are high.
Problem is you are pushing up the market prices with your buy order. If it’s too low and high in quantity you will get outbidden by someone else who comes in with .01C higher price. And if you attempt to sell it you will drive down the market and have to eat 8% tax on both fronts and the posting fee
"Actually the way it is handled is the people on the merging server lose all their territories and the people on the server being merged into keep all their territories.  Sooo..  your company could find a different company of the same faction with no interest in upgrading the stations and 25% housing taxes on the new server and no way to fight them to get it back.  Or you could find your faction owns NO territories on the server merged into.

It is very bad to be on the server being merged."
"We have a company leaving the server that owns windsward so they've set taxes to extreme until they lose their war tomorrow just to collect bank before they transfer.

Hopefully when they do mergers they'll check faction balance and merge appropriately"
How the fuck are you affording 3 house tax payment each week
"You don't have to activate/pay taxes for more than 1 house at a time even if you own more than 1. You only pay the taxes for the house you will be using at that time.

You can also target cheaper houses and lower tax territories if you can't afford to pay more."
"Echo Killer’s response. Also, just doing the 3 daily faction missions even 3 times a week, if you only play every other day, should give you enough gold to pay the tax on the house easy."
Same boat brother. Don’t have much time either. 3 faction mission take about 15 min max and then go have at it with whatever else you wanna do and have fun without worrying about taxes.
"The extra storage is definitely nice! The thing I value more than anything though is the fast travel. You don't have to wait the 3hrs+ for house recall cool down, as toy can reset cool down early with only 40 Azoth. That was HUGE for me, and had I known how valuable it was I would have gotten a house muuuch sooner. 

Everytime your bags are full, you can recall home and store /post to market and get right back to business via Inn recall. I got a tier 2 and the taxes aren't bad at all."
"You can reset the recall for 40 azoth so you can always travel to your houses for cheap. Even encumbered. Totally worth it just for that and t1 houses are like, one outpost rush to pay tax"
Buying houses was the best thing I ever did. More storage and no azoth bottleneck. Being able to freely move about is a money-maker for me. It allows me to get my goods to market more efficiently. I haven’t ever once had to cringe when paying taxes and that includes houses that are no longer in my factions territories.
T4 house can cost a lot more taxes if you ever get some asshat company that moves in and jacks up taxes
"I did that already. Yeah, i have tax reduction too. But when economy is bad not even yield gear can help."
im sure you'll be charged a default tax
"When you trade items with players you dont have a listing fee or a buying fee compared to posting on the trading post and someone buying it.

I.e i sell in chat 1 potion for 2 coins ill get 2 coins
I list it on the trading post for 2 coins ill get 1.8 or -w/e the tax rate at the time is"
"You get a discount on houses, taxes, and travel cost if your company owns a territory."
"This. Early game the leaders pumped a lot of money into the guild - me ( consul ) and leader were the last two people in our company to buy a house - even though we owned Winsward! Money all goes on taxes, upgrades, company food, crafting etc.  


As for company fun - everyone is in our discord - youll regularly have a dozen + people in a chat at all time of day - elite/corrupted runs and general chat all on discord. I think op had crap companies with no discord, or missed the discord invite."
increasing taxes is the privilege of the 'owning' company. it's by design and i wouldn't call this toxic. it's also not their fault if nobody can or is willing to challenge them.
They're holding the tax money for a transfer off the server instead of using any of it to upgrade the town.  Happening on my low-pop server as well.
Are y'all rich and just get major/basic trophies? Because my broke ass can barely afford the property tax of my two homes and the two minor corrupted trophies.
When i left olympus they had one company who had dupe hacked their way ahead of everyone gear wise own like 6 territories and would use exploits to win wars and then set housing taxes really high. Not sure if its still like that
"Take the T1 houses and feel reputation a bit. 

With 25-30% house tax reduction I pay between 150 and 200 gold for each house per week.  

Doing 3 PVP quest in restless shore gives me around 250gold a day and is done in less than 10minutes.

That is an easy money making that doesn't rely on trading, as selling items might be hard on dead servers."
"Nice! Being green, it's great to oppress yellow, but y'all really needed some territory to call home. 

And from the messages, it seems like yellow grabbed Fist Light? Gj if it was because fuck Grey lol. Those assholes are taxing up my Ebonscale Reach and are jerks in green chat"
"Fuck Grey & fuck any company that maxes taxes.
Bunch of clowns"
Yes but im not the One payng the taxes so i dont care
"On the server I play on the taxes were held at 5.0 in all cities due to concord...  They have crept to 7.5...  I have a feeling that the squeeze will be on as servers lose players so the guilds that control the towns can remain flush.

Congrats on rank 75 by the way -- that is higher than any of my city ranks by half(my best is 50)."
Don't try to pay the tax remotely. Go to your house and pay there. It will be discounted.
"I'm not sure, I just started to take screens but I feel like tax is jumping up and down without any settlement tax changes.."
Post the list here. Upvoted for Ags to fix ban system. I hope they face some legal actions for banning innocent players. You can be banned for selling an awesome hatchet via trade for gold selling. Why the fuck should i pay thousands of gold taxes using trade post??
"Wow...thats not good. I just checked some towns on our low pop server (today we had 190 people at peak ! ) and WW is earning 178k a week.  But almost everybody crafts there and no upgrades on fort,to keep upkeep at 35k/week.

Other towns, well, Monarch is at minus 8k and thats the only place with t5 arcane.

Property tax is main money maker, apparently. Monarchs is mostly inn spawn point"
"Does this mean Amazon is banning you for tax evasion? 

The irony is palpable.."
"nope. it does absolutely nothing except give you basically zero tax revenue. people think they're being clever and getting more money this way, but don't realize that lower taxes = more money."
"I believe so. 

Perhaps Dawnguard raised taxes as well prior to Snake's  rise, but Snake does a good job playing villain. 

It made for fun server rivalry."
This. Lost 5k on buy Order taxes bc nobody can sell..
"Tax will be a % of your full priced house without discount, so im assuming you have a t5 house worth 20k and taxes will be 10% which is 2k per week"
"I forgot about that, but i swear i was paying way less. 

I just found the formula: Tax Owed = Property\_Value \* Tax\_Rate \* (1.0 - Tax\_Rate\_Reduction) \* (1.0 - Company\_Discount)

    Tax Owed = 20000 * 0.099 * (1.0 - 0.2) * (1.0 - 0)
    Tax Owed = 1980 * 0.8 * 1
    Tax Owed = 1584

Its like the territory standing discount is not working."
"If you pay from the map, your territory discount won't be added (think it's a bug). Best place to pay taxes is inside your house itself 

That or taxes were raised? This is the only bug I can think of that changes how you pay you property tax"
"No. If you try to teleport to a house where the tax is due, you have to pay first and then you can teleport.

I havent found a way to pay ""remotely"" on schedule though."
"Meanwhile we had 5 Territory as green as soon as the transfers were enabled and we lost a war the Main leader took out the treasury set every tax to max and transferred to other server filthy rich (with his friends of course) . Green collapsed many transferred, many left the game.

Based on true story."
As the owners of Windward we loved it when the everfall owners jacked the taxes and transfered brought us alot of extra money.
"It kind of sounds like it's working like it should. Just don't pay the tax they won't get that income hopefully others do the same, they lose money and hopefully people rise and war them non stop until they lose it.

We did this on my server. We asked that taxes be lowered they said some words...we organized and made it so they could not hold the town."
"Here is the thing. The complaints are quite valid. The game has had massive server lag issues with the new patch, players have randomly lost equipment (again with this newest patch), the Trading post has gone down multiple times which has caused massive issues (like towns degrading b cause people are not able to pay the taxes), they have made the gam grindier which has hurt new players...

Oh and the cherry on top is that AGS created a Public Test Server and asked for feedback... And proceeded to ignore it."
"Make him pay taxes, you're roommates now!"
"Or even the playing field. Every weapon has to pay 0,4c taxes for every autoattack. Just like bow and muskets do."
They probably didn’t take taxes into account 🤣
"Go to a town with cheaper crafting taxes. Amazon doesn't set the tax, whatever company owns the town does"
Money sink means the money goes out of the game.. the tax goes to the company that owns the town. The money is still there.. just like buying an item from another player off global isn’t a money sink..
Gotta pay the healers tax.
"Pre patch, Sort by ""Time remaining"" in your trading post... Anything less than the downtime duration will be removed. Create a buy order for said items at say 50% the previous list price for these items... Anyone who sees their previous item returned to storage will probably direct sell vs relisting and paying the listing fee / transaction tax again."
I wonder if they refunded every cent of taxes you ever paid... like crafting fees etc...
"Same, log in from work just to see what i got. Seems i got nothin, lold. Same with harvester and taxes right before news about 90% discount"
"I read some article that said Jeff wanted New World to be able to do ridiculous calculations. I don't think he meant the ridiculous stuff going on in the game.  


If he says anything, it would probably be to shut it down for the tax write off."
"Ya EF jacked up the taxes on our server and chased a lot of people out.  WW was always the more popular town since we set taxes to the minimum, but the divide has grown.

I think the global market has expanded the market in the sense that their is now at least one profitable territory per faction. However this still leaves a lot of territory being worthless. Add in the fact that territories change hands pretty often and things start to get more random."
"Well, I mean, there isn't any treasury ledger ingame to know who donated/withdrew from the company, so I guess I'm already glad we have a weekly tax reporting ;-)"
"Players pay 90% less, companies get compensated for loss of income. The gap between that is what generates gold for them. You pay 400 gold instead of 4k in an extreme property tax situation, but the company receives way more than what you've payed as a compensation mechanic."
"no no no melee is already so taxing. My finger gets hella tired from smashing lmb, that is pain enough, leave the arduous material taxing to the range classes."
The main cities on my server all had their taxes at the max yesterday.  Hopefully they give us a heads up when the go back to the normal taxing so people don't get hit with the massive change.
Out lying areas dont make money especially on low pop servers. Windsward and Everfall make thier weekly taxes easily and then some.
Yeah but tax is now reduced by 90% so nobody will care.
There's no problem. Just telling you why nobody will get mad at tax increases for the OPs plan to work.
"I would lose money on that (around 50%) since linen costs around 2.5 times more than fiber on my server. Plus you don't pay taxes for fiber (costs less that 0.19g), but you do for linen"
"Is that actually how the taxes work? I always assumed that the UI just truncated the amount but that the actual calculations were done pre-truncation, e.g. 1 fiber has 0.009 tax so it shows and costs 0, but buying 2 would be 0.018 so you'd pay 0.01 tax total (could be rounding instead of truncation or it could be per item like the UI suggests, but I've never tested it)"
"Weekly tax = undiscounted price of the house (5000, 10000, 15000 or 20000) multiplied by the tax rate chosen by the controlling company (from 5% to 30%; currently from 0.5% to 3%), then you apply your potential territory standing discount."
"But it wasn't even an emergency, you could get 2-3 quin per wolf before the change which is about the same if not more value if you don't get lucky with bonuses and have to pay tax to upgrade.  Instead now we get no motes/quin but even more importantly no way to really farm the wyrdwood needed for end game crafting."
"Wait, where do you pay 620g property tax? Is this even possible after -90% discount?"
"I managed to furnish one of their houses before, I told them just don’t pay taxes on the other 2 unless they want fast travel."
"T4 house in everfall within a few days time of the game coming out. Kept it up through leveling but once i hit 60 and the game became what it did, i just stopped paying taxes. I have 200 armoring and can use the trophies but at this point i play this game differently than most. I only pvp and i use my gold as ""honor points"" if you will and the trading post is my pvp vendor. Never WM farm or do any pve or gathering at all anymore."
"My entire server is run by one faction. A faction-less server idea simulates this exact scenario, there would be very little change to gameplay, outside of people not having to worry about high taxes and would benefit only from territory reputation. The game might be designed around factions, but right now it's pointless if one server is completely overrun with one. Some players done care about PvP or competition. I for one enjoy the coop aspects more."
"I was wondering if i had misunderstood,  but no he was actually admitting he used tax money to level up his own skills... wtf?"
"Can you help me a bit, I am confused about the TAX rows.
Where do I get each of these values from?
(Listing fee MIN, Listing fee for 100000, etc)"
"I can't really work out what values to put into these fields, does anyone know?

Listing Fee MIN

Listing Fee For 100000

Price

Qty

ME Price net

ME Price gross

Max Craft Qty

Craft total Tax"
"Okay got it, thanks.

But I also need help with the rest.
(Price, qty, ME price net, ME price gross, Max craft, Craft total tax)

Also I think this looks like a good spreadsheet, I just need help setting it up :)

EDIT: I think i have an idea of how it generally works, I just want to make sure I get it right and don't end up losing coins instead"
"Any luck on setting up the Price and Qty under the listing Tax information? These are the only 2 I'm confused about.

&#x200B;

Is that the price and qty of the item I did the tax calculations with?"
"Sorry for that, It's not obligatory value for rest of sheets. I Add description for tax table, lets check and let me know it's now understandable."
">I Add description for tax table, lets check and let me know it's now understandable."
"Buy one? Houses make up for their initial cost by being 24/7 no cooldown recall points and the taxes are easily paid.

Also why would anyone have 200+ weight in furniture if they don't even own a house."
"Yeah man! I don't care about Amazons bottom line, if they lose money we'll call it a tiny contribution to the tax they owe. Just keep the game going, it's fun!
If they do that, players will come"
"The main reason for houses being so great are trophies and recalls around the map that you can reset cheap... If your faction doesn't control most of the map this makes them even more valuable. 

Yes taxes are temporarily cheap, but when they go back up it can get expensive on higher tier houses - most of the people I know that have them regret them. 

Ultimately getting 3 T1 houses in strategic locations and getting as many trophies as you can is far better than waiting and buying 1 big house."
AGS is giving everyone 90% tax rate cuts. :)
"I go by TP(trading post) value. All WTS/WTB I see on my server are usually within 500g MAYBE 1000g of the cheapest sell order on TP. My buy orders have been thousands of gold cheaper than the lowest sell order. For example, I picked up two precision engineering tools for 10k and 11k buy orders when the cheapest sell order is 16k before tax. I just listed the sell orders for 3 days and got 1 same day and the other the next."
"Yup, they just need to have a value for each territory, which is the accumulation of player interaction(housing/market/gathering) within the territory(they probably log all player interaction already). You plug that value into an exponential function and tax in % based on the result."
I thought housing should be capped at each settlement and that would create a market for houses. Failure to pay taxes on a reasonable time scale should have the houses go for auction and newer homes (instances) can be added via town projects. My thoughts where this would force people to take cheaper homes not in major towns and this would liven those markets.
"House and Taxes 🤣

We get to go to a mysterious new world and bring a little but of real life with us 😂"
"Yeah they need something quick. Even in WoW where there are two factions people just flock to the PvP server where their side holds a dominant majority. Most of the servers end up 99% one faction sooner than later. I would expect it to be even worse here, too, with all the tax systems in place."
"I feel like the tax settings system doesn't really have a purpose. Everyone just goes where taxes are lowest because it makes the most sense, so setting them higher ironically deprives the faction of revenue and players. No wonder every other town had low taxes while ours had High, our governor was a traitor."
"Legit sounds almost exactly like Moriai with Covenant taking Everfall, setting extreme taxes, having some level 15 set to governor and Syndicate/Marauders grabbing everything else"
"I was on last night and the seem to have reset them to low. Whats a MMO without a little guild drama. Honestly make things fun, like theres now a ""boston tea party"" company thats rallying on the promise of low taxes. Cracks me up."
"I'm in ad victorem and the governor set the taxes to high, not extreme. Also he didnt know you could only adjust it once per day. If other covenant companies would stop being selfish and actually join up to make another big one itd be much easier to get more territory. He also didnt know that the consul role has no withdraw limit because it also doesnt say that anywhere, so some people may have sjphoned off a bit from the taxes the first day but it couldnt have been more than 10k."
"You can use other guild/faction workbench, with a higher tax, I think"
"""Abussive Behaviour"" by going to chat asking who is selling starsteel tools for cheap since the taxes on the trade shop are higher warrants a ban? because that is all i did yesterday and got banned for it, unless if it was for me maybe talking shit then i deserve it but i would like to know what i did that warrant it a ban with a simple screenshot, since ""humans view the reports"" i want to know what that person saw that warrent me a 24 ban instead of a BOT! is that hard to ask?"
Yeah it wouldnt be so bad if one of the main functions of the game was to take territories as a company. But if you have players who are getting to almost 60 in 4 days with full professions while other players are in their late 20s to low 30s  the cheating players are going to control the servers and taxes in the towns on those servers.
"yep I stole from a multi billion dollar shit company that pays no taxes and steals probably more than me, all you are just but hurt you didn't do it.

But i'm the bad guy here."
Why should I help a company gain even more money to expand into more territories so they can raise taxes there. I immediately stopped all my business there and asked the server if we were going to take that. Taxes went down to moderate later so I guess the greedy purps learned their lesson.
Purples are clowning on my server all extremely taxes think property tax is 20% not moving there
I don't know what's hard about group says let's be communists then take power then most likely do the same thing all over again. Not really a hard math problem there now is there. A more apt one could be tea tax.
"I mean I'm arguing that in the game the meme sucks cause you literally can't change the tax portion. Either or one group is loosing out to another. 

I do see your an issue with your semantics."
You know what's a better meme instead of all that stapled on word play. American revolution. Fuck high taxes. It works better cause each individual keeps more of what they own because they worked for it.
You are talking about redistribution of wealth and tax is only one way to do it. Communism doesnt explicitly means high taxes.
It means taking stuff from others to support something. Communism's redistribution is essentially I high mother fuckin tax.
The other guy here explained it better. You cannot be taxed if you don't own anything and everything is shared. Tax doesn't exist in such world.
"If you enjoy crafting, gathering, trading etc then absolutely. You can get lost in the scenery mining or chopping wood for hours. 

Being said, SO FAR the endgame is directed at PvP…fighting over territories to control taxes and such. I think in the future they’ll add more to the PvE side as most MMO’s do but they have a unique niche in that the trading post/ market drives the game and revolves around wars."
"got it, fetch quests, generic fighting, generic crafting, horrible character customization/personalization, BS tax system , uhhhh ok got it"
Do you have enough gold to pay the crafting tax?
When in the house it gives you the option to pay the next week's tax. And 500 a week (cheapest house) isn't too bad
Yea if you view the house it gives you the tax rates
"I bought a 7,500 G one in everfall. Know that the 50 % bugged for the property tax as far as im concerned which is why I have to pay 2k per week. I don't know if one is better or not than 3 but it's say do it one at a time"
on my server yellow has no land and its 6 green 5 purple and no one can win a attack anymore for the time being. we took yellows only piece of land which was first light and tax gouged them to make them move.
"Just to be clear.

The first house you buy is half off on the sale price.
But the tax is only half off once?

How often do I pay tax, every week?"
I'm hearing conflicting reports bout the 50% weekly tax discount.  Are you sure its only the first week?  I had a guild member tell me he's been getting 50% off every week.
How high is the tax on the best houses? I thought I was only 1.5k?
Sales tax too.
hmm maybe if you sold a higher quantity you could make more mmoney than the sales tax
"Check the Trade Tax rates of each city before you pick one to set up your wares, and avoid the cities ran by shit companies in general."
I have seen a claim that it is not allowed to sell items in the chat since you avoid the marketplace and taxes are an important part of the game mechanics.
"well granted if you put 1000 lbs of starmetal up for 100g each, the taxes are going to be high..."
What happens if you don' pay the tax?
And first time house owners get 50% of taxes too so pretty sure theres no reason not to own a house right
taxes are cut in half on first house
"How much are your taxes? From what I've seen it would be around 4k a week, which seems incredibly expensive."
I read on the wiki first time home owners get 50% their weekly taxes too . Could this be a bug?
"Don't want it.

I would like to see a server ruleset that flagged folks who enter a territory that they don't own and 2 tax rates, one for faction members and one for outsiders."
"What server and what region? I find that ever fall is the most center to alot of things and is a big hub for most people's level experience. It's already been noted if your town is not competitive with taxes you before a ghost town. I am on Tipra Chonnlai west coast and average level of players seem to be 25 and under, I am 37 myself and in the 30 plus zones I am barley seeing people 2-3 at the most, but I do play in the late evenings so."
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT!!!!!   XD   I don't want to be reminded about taxes in my escapism!
You have to pay taxes for that.
Yes you have to pay a weekly tax for housing but it gives you an additional recall and the ability to have buff giving trophies and additional storage on top of the normal storage
Tax dodge is very serious crime around here
Because they don't have to move to pay 0 taxes.
Companies go to Ireland to keep international revenues away from USA taxes. It's a totally different subject called repatriation.
Denial.  Island tax havens are just fictious conspiracy theories.  They don't exist in real world.
"Casual player here. I can confirm that I plan on getting a house and figure out how to pay taxes. I just level up my crafting during my character's by farming what I need.
Buuuuuut. When all players like will a reach high level in crafting, the prices probably will skyrocket pretty high for iron and such low tier mats, given the quantity your need (Iirc)"
"You mean the Yellow company that named their company REDCOATS I and immediately made a REDCOATS II, then bought Everfall and jacked up the taxes so the entire server including your own faction hated you? So funny you are complaining about ""Copycat companies""

Also, ""They own 5 lands each between them""   Purple owns 4, Yellow (your faction) owns 4, and green owns 3 so thats also not true. And Purple and Green have been declaring war on each other each day. So yeah, stay salty"
"A large majority of players don't even PvP or flag, this just makes it worse. Because its pointless in the end, we all muted faction chat, grind an area you like untill you get tax discounts and ignore the system entirely. Loving the game just like that and am more excited for invasions."
Did you get your first week’s tax discount? I bought the house but the next tax is showing full price…
"I have lost more than 10k gold to taxes so far due to mistakes. 

You see, if you type or paste your gold amount before that page is fully loaded the numbers go crazy. 

That's how I posted 5 minor runes of holding for 34k and 1700 iron ore for 140 gold each. Rip."
"By the time you have the 30 standing you can also have like 20% reduced property taxes... It will suck when a Corp takes over and raises taxes to crazy levels.

Nearly there for my first house which will be in bright wood.  Can't wait to have a house with nothing but free items and 4 storage boxes."
T4 requires more work to maintain if you want to keep the benefits. The weekly taxes are the real money sink not the house cost. If the tax rate is maxed out you’re basically rebuying your house every 5 weeks
"You don't lose the house tho, just the benefits of it.

Does the missed tax stack, cause if it doesn't paying 1600 gold when you come back from a break in playing wouldn't be so bad."
"I get that it's not fun to have your town downgraded if people from companies that own their territories soft-throw, honestly I think that should be punishable if proven.

But that's the risk of having a tax-income heaven, where you can make thousand upon thousand of gold.

Not to mention if they could handpick 50 from their own corp, then if they just asked them to donate war-spoils(gold) that would be avg 25k each invasion evne on loss and I can only imagine more on winning."
"what would you recommend? :o

and how much does a t4 house cost? do you have to pay like weekly taxes or something"
"T4 house cost 20k but first house u buy have 50% discount, yes there are weekly taxes mine are 1,300 gold rn. U choose what is easier for u rods need cloth instead of iron, depends what u can farm better."
I have 26k gold... but haven't bought a single house (really want a T4 in everfall) because of property tax.
"I just wont pay taxes that week, chances are I won't be there that much unless I'm doing gathering runs- it does help that my company owns the territory and is quite competent. 

I only just recently found out you don't have to pay taxes so that definitely swayed my decision that and the 20K house only cost 8K with the two bonuses(first time buyers/ company owns territory) taxes still like 600 tho"
"US West - Phlegethon… we’re about 70% green, 30% yellow, 0% purp. Taxes are high/extreme most places. It’s brutal. Purple is generally in good spirits though - viewing this as a repressed underdog origin story."
We're on our way to this. The company that holds the most is now content locking people out from wars. I had a feeling this would happy. Fuck you simply. Begged for money to buy the first zone and used all the taxes money to get more.
More then 24 hours. If they do that and take all your territories then jack the taxes up this is a game killer level exploit
"I can afford the houses, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to pay the property tax over a sustained period."
"This sounds like a great plan.

I was thinking of a second house but I honestly don’t think I can afford taxes on both"
Unpopular opinion; taxes bad
"NO. Crafting is extremely important due to the lack of raw gold in the game, it’s honestly best to level all your crafting to 150 to start crafting your own level 60 gear

Also you can make a lot of money by selling certain gear since the game is still new, i’ve made 42k from mass crafting T3 amulets and selling the gathering luck ones

Since I only use the things I craft and find in the open world, all the money will go to house taxes, chisels and bag crafts from faction shop"
Any accounting/tax experts around? Could it potentially be an issue to buy a microtransaction to be used on a server in one region and then move that microtransaction to another region.
"Guys things will change it’s like week fuckin 2….. I hate how you kids post these maps yet fail to realize in a month or two it’ll change. There are wars literally everyday. You think these kids just gonna no life, not leave the computer and keep winning wars for years / months?????

God you nerds cry so much, I love taxing the fuck outta you peasants

syndicate rule forever"
Wait me explaining to someone else why green has a lot of territories is me being a little bitch? That is super confusing hah. And yep we know the pain of everyone bitching about taxes
"As someone who is a consul in a company that owns multiple settlements, we're borderline broke constantly. We're not rolling in money buying houses and trophies for people. We're trying to afford high tier upgrades and pay our own taxes (which are 15-20k by themselves somedays)"
"People in an owning company collecting tax can easily drop gold on things they need. Since I'm not in one, I just want to make money off of them."
"I only have to pay $600 a week for my two houses, why are your taxes so high? Do higher tier houses cost more for tax?"
"yeah, it's a percentage of the house cost. I'm paying 600ish on my tier 3 house and tbh since I'm playing alot, I regretted not going for tier 4. My tax bill right now is 600 since I picked the property tax decrease territory standing reward every time I could."
"Yes, taxes are optional. You keep your house and the storage space either way. You lose the teleport and global buffs.

And instead of ""losing"" something, think about it as getting a temporary boost if you decide to pay the taxes. Plan to do a lot of farming in the next days? Pay the tax. Doing dungeons and story and whatnot? No taxes this time."
"There are already mechanics that prevent camping. 

And I’d like that too so you pve players can watch the game crumble around you. 

No action. No drama. No companies fighting over anything. It’ll be borderline impossible to get wars going on a pve server. Hell if it was pve only that whole section of the game would totally disappear. I assume all towns would just be set to low tax and be owned by Jeff bezos. 

Castles are just for decoration. 

Town upgrades are randomly selected."
I think late game people will get lazy to farm stuff when they need it enough to drive a demand. But that demand will be extremely taxing on low level materials
"Not in your house, please NO.

I don't want to be forced to buy a house in NW and start paying virtual taxes."
"It’s not much lol. You pay tax every time you trade something or craft. It’s 30 mins of work for three T3 houses. ( or you do 1 war per house, I do around 2-3 wars a day) but I hear you it kinda sucks"
"on my server, purple won every single war they fought against green and talked a bunch of crap afterwards (warranted bc in the first few days of launch green overextended and bought a ton of territory and were very toxic and elitist). green ends up taking WW from purple (their first win after a 9 loss in a row streak) and hiked the property taxes up to the maximum they can be, just as a petty “F you” to purple. sometimes, it IS too much of a hassle to own a house"
Isn’t the territory tax a percentage of the tax you’re paying ?
"I have a problem with this because when I was in the buy screen it showed me this 

Price: ~~20,000~~ 10,000
Tax : ~~1700~~  850 
 
Then I buy the house and the tax is 1700 lol.  And the region is set at 8% tax.  Even if it was 10% with no region reduction that should only be $1500.     Something seems bugged to me.  If mine said 700 I wouldn't be complaining either lol"
How long is each pay period? Also do you know what happens if you buy a house but can’t pay taxes? Thinking of buying one soon so was just wondering
"If i want to buy a T4 house for my first house, on territory that is not own by my faction, and has max tax rate of 15%, while my tax discount are at ~23%, what is the weekly tax that i will need to pay?"
"I'm glad you found it helpful! There's been a lot of confusion on house taxes, so I thought I'd clear things up for people if possible. Once I pay my first period in 3 hours, I'll know some additional information about future weeks as well."
The 1st week discount (first time house buyer) on taxes was confirmed to be a UI bug.
"It will be somewhere around there, or in my case, 1.4k. The territory tax reductions are pretty huge for reducing your property tax per pay period."
"I'm 100% sure it was $1,700 and $850. I just logged in and was wrong about the territory tax though. It's set at 8.5%. My faction controls the territory but not my company. So I don't think i get that bonus?

I also got a 5% discount from territory standings.  

So the amount due right now is $1,615. 

If i go look at the other t4 house it shows house price is 20k and tax is $1,700. 

So it just adds up to getting 5% off from the territory standing buff. I think it's just bugged for some of us."
"It's possible that it's bugged, but I find it odd that it would be bugged in a way that perfectly matches up to a dynamic tax rate, when pretty much every other person has been complaining that they couldn't find this tax rate. Can you show a screenshot?"
"Well here is all my screenshots. I think the dynamic tax is all there is. https://imgur.com/a/ga5rfSt

 House cost  x  dynamic tax = total tax

Because 20,000 x 0.085 = **1,700**

Then subtract 5% from territory standing and you get 1,615. 

It's just missing the first time home owner discount. Everything else adds up to me. Maybe im missing something?"
"First pay period is 7 days, each pay period thereafter is 5 days. I don't know why it's different. 

If you can't afford the house, you lose the benefits from the house while your taxes aren't paid, but that's it. You lose the fast travel point, the extra storage, and the trophy boosts, but the taxes don't accrue, so you can just show up and pay taxes whenever you want access to the house again."
"Thanks so much for the reply! That is really good to know that I can at least choose when to “have a house” by paying the tax for that week. 

I think I may buy the house and just pay the tax the week I really need the storage etc. 

It is interesting, I’ve been following the comments and seen the discussion on whether the discount is applied in perpetuity. I have saved this post and switched on notifications so I know when there are updates.

Again thanks a million times over for the info!"
"The remastered quality is perfectly fine, what you are talking about is the ultra-something which is super taxing on the system and it was meant for streamers. 

The remastered one, which is still demanding, looks phenomenal. And it runs at 60+ on my GeForce 1080 @1440p."
How much of house taxes payed actually goes governor?
"It feels like work playing this game man, sad to say it. As much as I love and loved it before release, I can't last longer than an hour a day now. I've got a real mortgage and taxes and income to worry about, I play games to have fun not to be reminded of those feelings"
"30% lower tax if owned by COMPANY? I thought it was if it's hold by my faction?   
Chances for me owning a large house get smaller and smaller. It's just too expensive."
WHy are you calling taxes rent lol...big difference.
I'm almost 100% certain that taxes were also discounted by 50% the first week.
"Oh how i wish the other professions also had town board quests... 

If i remember correctly those quest recipes do not event cost crafting tax."
"I'm always under 500 because my faction has no territory.. taxes are all set to 20% so housing is not even an option.

It costs 150-400 (empty) to teleport around..

Got like 5 towns storage maxed out for crafting different trade skills so I move around a lot. Even tho most of it is running to gather on the way to places.

Then there's singing up for wars and when finally finding a group for expedition sometimes I need to move to take quests and such.. no one's gonna wait an hour for me to run lol."
"While you get the discount for your first house, just be aware that the discount on taxes, is only for the first week."
