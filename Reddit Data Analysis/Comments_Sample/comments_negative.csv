"Jokes aside it is dumb you cant move from those servers to normal ones, not sure prioritizing economy over saving a server is better",The 2500 player server cap is a gift that keeps on giving. It fragmented the player base after the initial rush faded when the game launched. If fragmented the player base after the initial rush faded with fresh start servers. It has prevented communities from forming or growing throughout the life of this game. Its one of the worst design choices made for this game but was necessary because they insisted on sticking with territory control in the main world instead of instancing that game mode off like other games do,"frash start servers were such an imbecilic idea, devs should never listen to the players with their dumb takes",Yeah it’s pretty dumb that fresh can’t transfer to legacy.,Im not sure how to feel about another max expertise/gear score increase. It looks like another meaningless way to make us play more without much effort on their part.,"I feel like were just waiting for features that should have been in the game from launch, like transmog and gear storage","WHERE IS THE NEW PVP CONTENT? A new map for arenas and cross server capabilities is not new content. Tweaking the PVP track is not new content.Where are the new OPR maps, and new PVP game modes? Changing up the scoring system on the same old stale OPR map is not new PVP content and will not keep the PVP players engaged. The PVE players are getting 3 expeditions and 2 trials, and the PVP players get….. crickets? WTF?","Ags here, we are finally indicating which circles will heal you and which wont. Enjoy your new pvp content (still playing one map two years after release) Lmao /s",As a semi-casual PvP oriented player Im disappointed with this roadmap. Cross world arenas in winter? No ranked games this year? So many PvE oriented changes and so little PvP focused ones.,"putting ""colored outlines for enemy aoes"" into your content roadmap is actually fucking pathetic",Were not getting gear set until fucking spring? This should have been out a year ago.,Still no new pvp activities at all. For fuck sakes AGS gives the pvp players more things to do.,"Yeah, they’ll just shut down the game lol. The dev team cares about one thing, profitability. Once it stops, the game will. There’s no passion in this project, and it shows.",AGS devs have such fucked up priorities.,I believe the AGS devs are lizard people since they dont understand human beings or their own game.,Im confident that they not only don’t play their own game but have not played any mmos ever.,Stop playing the game or at least stop giving them money guys.,"They had a really great style and aesthetic going into the game, and immediately ruined it with this ridiculously ostentatious golden armor twitch drop.","Everything went to shit the moment mmo streamers got involved in august 2020. Combat, game design, cosmetics/aesthetics.","Honestly, this is massively turning me off. I was thinking of coming back with the revamp to starting areas, but some of the clownish cosmetics I’ve been seeing are giving me pause. I loved the theme of the game and a lot of this doesn’t fit.","You know how sad it is that we have to pray for good PAID skins to come out, while in-game skins (armor pieces) are completely neglected.",They definitely have dropped some of the worst looking skins in any game I’ve played,"Cuz we, who bought the game, are clowns because weve been scammed","Destiny has some dope armor ornaments though, like tons of them, everything in this game looks like shit.","I would not be surprised if AGS source development of skins just to save money and time. Nothing looks like it fits the game, most of them are themed to some sort of real life event regardless of the new world lore.","Opposite of kicking a dead horse, they brush and pet it like it is just a sleep.",The issue is they focused so much on PvE since launch and not PvP. The PVP in this game offers something no other MMO can deliver while the PvE is mid at its best. So what do they do? Abandon PVP and continually bring out boring PvE.,I’ve already moved on to another game. Really tired of trying to find players let alone reliable ones to run a damn m2,I dont see how such a beautiful game can fail so utterly hard on character models and skins. Whoever is in charge of cosmetics needs help asap.,"I wanted to like this game. I got to around level 45 and just got a little bored with chopping down trees, mining and gathering.","Well it still heats up my PC like no other game, even the newest AAA games with better graphics. I really wish they could touch a bit more on optimizing it.",Or maybe it shows they continue to have weird priorities and dont understand why 97% of players left their game.,This is beyond milk and is now a curdled slop of mold.,I mean it’s kinda sad that it took so long until it got to this “base state”. Nobody is gonna return to play and eventually it’ll be shut down/ chalked up as a loss by Amazon.,"That potential was squandered (probably not by the dev team, but by the dev teams leadership )",They designed a pvp game. Then took the pvp out of the open world. I was done at that decision.,Paying for teleport. Paying for running dungeons. Paying for storage. Paying for a rent. Everything in that game was designed to be a chore.,I find almost every skill in this game very boring and uninteresting,Its safe to say that about 70% of this sub isnt playing. Were just here reading to take in the suffering and pain of people... And maybe looking if anything has changed yet.,I stay in this sub just to watch people with hope for the game slowly hate it,"This has been said before, but i really put it down to the lack of mob and zone diversity. Its 2021 and we are still stuck with the same models in every single zone that we have to grind out. There is nothing exciting on the horizon that is making me want to level up","Agreed. You go and kill 30 skeletons and run to the next zone and kill 30 skeletons that are a different color. Rinse, wash, repeat. Content is definitely lacking in that category.","At first I thought I was exploring something with the depths of the ocean, then as my foot entered the water, I realized it was only puddle deep.","Exactly same here, 32 in Brightwood about to run for 10 minutes to next quest locations and it just hit me; meh, why bother?Games gets old quick",Yup. People get shit on once by a player 15 levels higher than them and never turn it back on,It’s because there’s literally no quest content in this game and the wall is horrible. You have to portal grind. The 45-60 wall is horrifically worse. Source: am 60. The game is barebones as fuck on questing.,"Oh dear god, the fucking ""Go loot these chests"" again quests. How can I take my own musket and shoot myself in the head?","The quest variety is absolute shit. They need to put a team on cranking more of them out. Yeah, I get it. They are grindy quests that you constantly take and there can never be a big enough amount to not have them feel repetitive... but the current amount is just way too small.","Then I hit 30, the fatigue hit me like a brick wall. I powered through it until level 34, and now that power through it mentality is fucking gone. It just feels like I am doing the same thing over and over and seeing nothing new. Wars, PVP, Quests, Fighting, Trading, Dungeons, all 11 weapons... it all looks the exact same.I almost feel like I could at this point just uninstall it, and never look back.","The game is bland. When I realized its copy and paste in almost every aspect of the game, it lost its charm for me after 30-40 hours of playing. Grinding games like RuneScape is rewarding because there is new things to look forward to, but in New World there really isnt anything to look forward to",Game is trash. People are finally starting to realize it after the novelty of the first week wore off. Its the same copy pasted uninspiring content from 1-60.Makes you wonder where the fuck all the development time went,runs to the toilet to vomit,They always make the helmets so goofy I hate it,More garbage. Not even surprised any more.,When you think it can’t get worse and then u see this,Awful armor designers for this game,"So much this. I nlreally wanted to heal, but its just so clunky, and the mouse wheel scroll selection is atrocious.",All I want is a better chat UI. It’s down right fucking horrendous.,It’s so depressing. I’m not as negative as forums but it really makes for miserable pvp. I think the worst part is my friends are leaving because how bad pvp is right now and they are the only ones I play with,"This is a sad fact, many feel theres no counterplay and just leave the game",Even worse is how common aimbots are among them and the devs are doing nothing about it,"Pvp is unplayable in its current state, stopped playing because of it",Theres a reason this game lost 60% of the returned players in the last 2 months. They dont want to deal with this shit again. Looks like they will lose even more this month.,The exact same mob models popping up at every zone is a real immersion killer though. I wish they would do something about it.
