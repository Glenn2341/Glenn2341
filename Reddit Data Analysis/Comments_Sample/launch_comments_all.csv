Yes. First days people are trying it and then they decide probably that they dont like it or dont put time in it anymore. Nearly always goes like this with hyped up games.
"This game really does feel like a single-player game with limited multiplayer capabilities in various aspects. You can’t share faction/town board quests, can’t share/trade BoP items in dungeons. Can’t craft various items for others due to BoP. Absence of banquets/feasts for group food buffs. (This could have been a cool thing for people with maxed cooking.) There are no bonuses incentivizing others to play together in a party while leveling/progressing. Even your party members don’t show up on your compass."
In my experience I hit 60 and started the GS grind and the game lost all of its charm.

"Try to get your crafting to a point where you can use t3/t4+ mats and you'll understand why there is a glut of supply and no demand.  

The game just requires an INSANE amount of t1 materials - for everything.  The whole system is extremely bottom heavy.

For instance, lets say you mine 120 starmetal ore.  In order to turn that into starmetal ingots, I need 480 iron ore in addition to that 120 starmetal ore.  It's far easier to get 120 SM ore than 480 iron ore, so the SM ore is vastly depreciated in value."

Paid full price with 170 hours so I've gotten my money's worth out of it and still want to play through the issues.
It happens in every new MMO. People will trash all the current MMOs. Then a new MMO gets released. And everyone wants the new MMO to copy all the other MMOs that they constantly shit on. Then when the new MMO starts copying the other MMOs they will start shitting on it haha.
Lots of weights need to be looked at. For example wood is less weight or similar to other items that should be half.

"This patch would have been fine if the game was in open beta and an official launch was just around the corner. But for a live game, punishing players that havent reached 200 in their trade skills or havent farmed watermark is a new low and they are out of their minds if they think these changes will make players want to play more.

Players want challenging and rewarding content, not hard, boring, repetitive and unrewarding chest runs."

Have you been to the forums? They are also filled to the brim with all the same criticism you'll find here. The Amazon Games team knows. No individual player or even giant forum full of players can successfully work to kill New World. The only thing that will kill or not kill New World is its ongoing ability to retain players.

I’ve really enjoyed the game but the last 2 weeks with the dupes/bots has really made me lose some motivation to play. I went from playing all day on my days off and a few hours after work to hardly logging in the last few days. I’ll still play occasionally but I’ll probably wait for Elden Ring release and move on.
the heavy gear looks like a beast meanwhile my light gear looks like a homeless person got thrown into a mad max movie..
The program they are running informs them what fish they will catch from a list. When they are catching common fish they will immediately break their lines. If its a rare fish they all the sudden sit there and reel it in no problem. This is a similar script to Hacks you'll see in Tarkov and other looters. Very bad that they are just blatantly doing this.

"100% agree that roads should grant a small speed buff. The roads in NW are so well connected so it would be great to utilise that.

However, having the same speed as going off road means you're more likely to cut corners and wander off the beaten track (pun intended) and take a detour to get that Blightroot you need or hunt that Boar for your Town quest.

Adding mounts and/or speed buffs to roads would reduce that organic meandering (in my humble opinion at least)"

"I think part of the fatigue with NW is also due to the setting being low fantasy, translating in little variety in mobs (wolves, boars, linxes, the alligator every now and then, and undead everywhere).

So what exactly do you do when you have everything?
"Welcome to open world PvP where being flagged isn't mandatory.
Open world means that there's no matchmaking. While leveling and while being alone you're constantly disadvantaged. Being able to turn PvP off means that you won't find others on your level to fight.

By the way both things the community wished for during alpha. The original idea was that everyone had PvP turn on all the time and that level difference didn't matter much."
The Great Cleave has more level appropriate quests than Edengrove.
"For genesis dungeon, the required amount of corrupted lodestone has been reduced from 10 to 2. That means the amount of corrupted portal runs u had to do has been reduced significantly."
"You can always do townboard missions for gold. 50 starmetal ingots and you get like 8 coins as a reward. Over a period of 2 years that will give you several thousands of coins, at least 2. So good!"
"The worrying part is a lack of transparency as to why someone is banned.
 From all I can see and feedback from others you’re a well known crafter and simply plying a trade- is that’s the reason they have banned it seems completely out of order, but with no transparency we’ll never really know (not that I’m doubting OP, but it’s hard to prove without Amazon’s input really)."

"Not just running, but while mining, skinning and doing pretty much anything that otherwise occupies your character model. I get they want us to look at our characters while we equip armor, but there are so many times I just want to check my inventory while doing something."

So I respected all my attribute points into strength and started playing with a GA instead. But everytime I want to join an expedition group as tank, I have to pay the respec fees."
Ah yes. Into the Void. AGS knew exactly where the game is headed.
"The game has so much tedious gatekeeping, it basically cant function unless everyone is playing"
I quit the game. Just wasn't having fun anymore with all the issues. I understand the 80k drop.
People will ruin this game. And people like that Streamer should be perma-banned from Twitch and New World.
"As a developer for a software company, there are so many deadlines we’re forced to meet and it really sucks because some things just aren’t ready"

Another reason locking content behind grindfest keys are a terrible idea.
"Lol 2 of us did this while we waged war on a territory to win a fort, the 2 of us tried to sneak the fort while our main group did missions. Enemy blob came to defend fort instead of stop pvp missions for some reason and for a joke I typed ""Yo, /roll for fort, lowest roll leaves fort until conflict resolved?"" and they actually stopped chasing us and the leader agreed.

Ended up winning a BO3, they left, we took fort, fun times were had all round!"
"Ice/Fire mage: lol, pray that the bug is positive not negative"
I have done this for multiple people and have not been banned. You could have just been doing dupes before this.
The community is bad so let me tell you all to fuck off???
Holy Sh**
"Umm, according to my graph, 200% of duping was stopped. It says so right here."
I have no idea why people are down voting you. What you did was common practice in Wow Classic and TBC. Anyone that does shit like this should be shamed and exhiled by the server community.
Hammer skill sound effects are on point too
"I'm nearly level 50, my grades are slipping, I unexpectedly became the pvp logistics officer of a company with like 15 people at most, can't level up my armoring or sell my bags, I'm loosing sleep to pvp counter-missions because my faction managed to grab BW and EF at the start and just recently won WW so the yellows and Greens have been running missions constantly...

I don't mind how it is I just wish there was more efficient ways to farm it. Or at least let it slowly regenerate throughout the day/night so when I log in I have a full bar to be able to play with
"Honestly most of my friends at level 30 are burned out on the game, and burned out faster than me. There is nothing to do at midgame but grind."
Crafting and selling are my favorite parts of MMOs. My only gripe with this game is the trading post. The UI is junk when it comes to keeping track of what sold and when. WoW did it right. Something sells? Get mail with the money. Easy to follow what's going on. Plus that dopamine hit when you log on and see the little mail icon next to you character pic.
"Hopefully all 100 players can connect for our war, imagine losing territory to queue"

It’s why I tell people Medium is the way to go. Light exists only for the roll which tbh, who cares."
How the fck has none of this been fixed? If they don’t ban and remove all the duped items and gold I think it’s time to quit the game
Ahhh reminds me of my server where the owner of Brightwood advertised for people to buy houses there then changed taxes from like 5% to 20% lmao
"I did not cheat, and did not get banned.

 my character Lickatung got banned for an offensive name and I have to wait 24 hours??! This is kinda crazy. Pokémon themed name and now I have to wait 24 hours to play a game with my friends for a name that was from a cartoon show made for kids.  This can’t be real?
"Sure as long as they have light armor, no onyx, no resiliancy, don't use dodge, play like idiots and don't know how to use a healing potion. Wow"
Only one of my company members who duped got banned so far. Everyone who used a family shared account seems to be fine.
They released a new weapon and the player numbers yesterday were abysmal.
Why can't you share quests? Same reason there isn't a raid group ui in the game. AGS decided that not thinking anything through for 5 minutes was a good way to develop their flagship game.

"Devs are doing what they can. The game was released too early, and they probably tried to stop it."
"The game wont die in two weeks, but Im willing to bet that it wont take long to lose a large amount of players as everyone hits 60 and realizes there really isnt much to do. The average player isnt going to stick around just for the pvp and New Worlds biggest downfall is its repetitive zones and lack of content."
"welcome to the age of streamers ruining computer games, finally the circle is complete, soon we will all be going outside and using our imaginations again"
"I think its impossible to make any balance judgments whilst the resilient perk and other perks dont work as intended. With skins in the mix, you never know if you are up against someone with full faction gear + onyx gems for a total of 35% dmg reduction from everything. 

When they finally fix the perks, thats when we can actually start judging weapon balance."

"I hit 60, there's no difference from being 55.  I still have quests to do, I'm still on the look out for expeditions and I'm still crafting.  Honestly getting high crafting gives me anxiety when I look at how many mats are required"

Isn't the AFK timer 20-25 minutes?
"I'm not even mad at the devs, I just want the game to work without all these game breaking features.

Its even worse there is a huge chunk of the player base abusing all this shit maliciously at the detriment of the legitimate players who just want to play the game."

I have a quest at level 58 to kill an elite in ebonscale. I literally couldn't even damage it before it killed me. Fun times ahead.
As an alpha/beta tester I can assure you the economy issues were pointed out early and often during beta. The game is basically gonna die a rapid economic death if they don’t step in soon; but as they have ignored this problem for the last several years already I don’t have much faith they can or will fix it now either.
Give musket grievous wounds(anti-healing)

Wow congrats! You sexy whale of man! Too bad your GS is only 539! Now you have to farm them all over to get to 600.
This meme is gold and put to well use!
a quest line for every trade skill that adds unique rewards for that tradeskill is some primo conent needed to fill gaps in the 1-200 journey primo updates and communication
Those involved in both the reporting and the decision on this probably aren't even aware this is a joke because they aren't old enough to know about making a phone call to an 800 number let alone for something like this.
"This is actually a really popular opinion, the majority will always be silent because they have nothing to complain about."

"In your inventory, you can sort your things by weight, Gear Score and Tier by clicking the symbols in the top right corner. And you can transfer all items of one category at once by clicking the arrow right on the categories top right.

"I'm enjoying it too, but no amount of enjoyment changes the fact that 80% of the tooltips in the game are incorrect. 

Less than half of the life staff skill nodes do what they say. 8 of them have NO EFFECT. Not like ""oh that's so unhelpful, no one should pick it"" but like it says ""do X"" and x doesn't happen. People are concerned about visual bugs, macro level economy stuff, and game modes being disabled, meanwhile the core weapon system doesn't work yet."
"Pretty much the same when it comes to tanking. Every time I just stand there while holding block and don't move, everyone praises me for how well I'm holding the boss in place for them to dps. As soon as I counter attack, the boss starts flailing around like it's feet are on fire. 

Again, I think this game needs it's armor effects reworked from scratch. A level 2 boar should not be able to push back a heavily armored soldier."
Myrk certainly not worth doing at the moment
Just a reminder to everyone you can change your review.
"Idk bro he did say under 40 and you’re 40.

The customer service is really lacking in this game. My friend got banned after he made a new character on other servers to see where to move to.   He has submitted multiple appeals but they gave him a different reason everytime and said do not contact us any further....
"I'm just chilling at 25, doing faction quests so I can be a green dandy (marauder light armour) and getting distracted by every piece of candy"
The PVE quests absolutely feels like a beta or even an alpha. They feel like placeholders which is what I thought they were in the last beta. I'm level 32 and I don't think I can do another chest hunt quest in a copy paste spooky village.
He’s been exploiting since day 1.  People have post about it before and he has never been banned. He will never get banned due to his status.

Not a fun time to be a fire/ice dps. Hopefully they fix it soon.
"You know gaming has hit a new low when the community is actively trying to hide dupers in some way to keep hitting that copium that everything is fine.

I personally think this is the final nail in the coffin for most players, Because it shows that even on a casual level it's not even worth to log on and farm stuff for gold.

(you might not agree with me). But this gold is never being tracked down and erased with the current issues the devs have."
"biggest one i'm looking for is the fix to harvesting nodes that don't despawn (and you can't harvest)

i've bumped into a bunch, and i *think* i've been able to trigger them by moving right at the moment the collection finishes"
As long as you can get those resources elsewhere knock yourselves out.  If you gatekeep resources behind pvp  then you'll loose portions of your player base.
I will admit that i have used it to store items. But i also put it at market price so if some one does buy it they can.

Haha ok now THAT is game breaking...
"I'm curious, how will they actually fix this? For example, duper puts 100 void ingots in the trading post for 10g a piece. Legitimate players see that and buy some, and go on to create a piece of voidbent gear with those duped ingots. Are they going to delete that piece of voidbent gear entirely along with the other materials they used? I don't see what they could do that would be fair."
"I honestly didn't give a shit tbh when I first saw this, because so many people are guilty of doing stuff like this in New World.

"Being high-population doesn't make you good or bad.

"Idk OP I’m burned out from running the same quests over and over, my desire to play is still strong. Me taking a few days off isn’t gonna get me jazzed up about delivering a large salmon from the trading post and looting 5 trinkets from chests.

That being said, I love the game but some aspects are definitely repetitive to a fault."
"Done, but I don't like how they lumped certain things together.  For example leveling fishing and logging is way too slow and tedious.  But harvesting and mining and skinning are fine as far as I'm concerned.  Some of the crafting skills aren't too bad to level, others are.  

And then at the end when they asked for a single biggest issue I couldn't.  There are too many to list that couldn't give a correct answer."

I was pvping against a level 58 earlier. Some people's grinds are insane lol
"Till yesterday people wanted more ways to generate gold.

Now there is an infinite source and you are still not happy?!

Troll aside the only way to fix this is a reroll. Just permabanning all exploiters won't save anything at this point. If the expoliters want they can empty every single marktplace and create millions of legit gold in some hours."

I couldn't agree more. Farming Myrk is getting old as hell.  Getting badly rolled gear just to salvage. Then getting 1 shot when someone pulls the big guy with the huge sword.
My desire to keep playing this game drops significantly with each of these nee exploits. If it was just bugs then that is one thing because they will be fixed eventually but these exploits have fucked the whole game.

"There was a quest that took me from like all the way west in Brightwood to all the way east in Weavers Fen to kill one enemy then go all the way back. That's when I was finally like this isn't okay. Capping the Azoth then essentially forcing me to burn it. I have amazon prime, let me fast travel for free."
Isnt this against Twitch tos too?
100% deserved lmao
Your patronising use of “some kid” makes me think you said some dumb shit to him.
This was done because you can cheese desync wars by stacking 50 ice aoes and it would basically kill the server.
Clearly you never did Silver Wastes on Guild Wars 2.
"Can confirm that these showed up on Nav too running Windsward pvp missions. You can clear em out but they just reset and then try to run them again.

Seems like no big deal but there are 10-15 of them at least and they are running 24/7 currently."
Some people are looking for just an evening of enjoyment. 2 weeks? Sounds good to me.
Before this game was released everyone was worried drops would be better than crafted gear. Now it's pretty clear crafted gear is better in every way but people are mad they can't just get 600gs drops within two weeks of being 60.
"People tend to forget that's an MMO if first and foremost build around an social playground.

We didn't make a casino but a fight club. Solo or groups format depends on the mood. Entry fee and winners take all. Sometimes we divide the cash pool for giving something to the second and third places.
No pot/no food/no drink. Sometimes we allow healer sometimes not, depend on the mood too.

The non participants keep an eye for anyone breaking the rules set. Reputation is build and the community thrive for more."
"Our server is low pop but a miracle happened, all the factions are banding together to try and save 1 or 2 towns and level up all the crafting and refining stations there. The whole server will fight to defend it from invasions and share in the spoils and low taxes"
"Some people really do struggle to just play fairly, don't they...."
Nice! I'll probably never touch it but that is great for the pvpers! They needed to do something to incentives players to flag it.
Everyone says run heavy for pvp but no one talks about the repair cost (except this guy).
"I love playing with the musket, but jesus Crist the damage is so low for 3 hours to reload"
"I can understand a one-time tuning orb to gain access to somewhere, but needing one each time? That’s just tedious.

Especially seeing the drop rate of slivers needed to make them. I ran corruption spots with a couple of buddies for like half an hour and got *two* slivers. That’s just not gonna cut it. I’m not farming stuff for 3-4 hours to do a 45 minute dungeon.

Waste of time."
"If you don’t own Brightwood, Windsward or Everfall, I can promise you that you are dependent on weekly fees from your company members if you want to upgrade your city. The taxes barely cover the upgrades and you have to pay a weekly fee (for comparison this week we have to pay a fee around 100k) because otherwise your territory will be downgraded."

"How do they expect a 5-man party to kill elite in a area ‘designed’ for a party? We tried it yesterday, the mobs kept respawning and fucking us up while the elite hp was barely chipping away."

I literally just figured this out last night by accident while messing with the different materials uou can choose for one slot. This is all really good info though. And intelligently put.
"I mean I know the Governor of one of the towns on my server pays roughly 170k every 5 days and then pours endless gold back into the town.

Doesn't really make a profit unless it's a huge town."
I can't be the only one disappointed it wasn't at least an epic if it rolled at 600gs. That would've been really cool.
"This is proof positive there is no satisfying this subreddit, they have been crying about removing all the dupes items and gold and now we have a guy that can’t read the post far enough to see that 98% was removed and has the audacity to ask why when the reason is in plain sight. If that’s not enough you got people with baseless claims that they are lying about the numbers, I can only imagine what other tin foil hats they wear outside of this subreddit."
"Yes they have, here's the full statement; 

""We are aware of **[INSERT THING HAPPENING]**. Please **[APOLOGIZE/CONGRATULATE]** us for that, since it is a **[UNINTENTIONAL/INTENTIONAL]** thing. Please expect **[LESS/MORE]** of this things happening on your server."""
"The healing targetting is also absurdley clunky, and I've played around with all manner of variation on the targetting settings.   
it's probably fine for just pve, but as a mainly pvper it's been horrifyingly jank."
The hard part is obtaining the gems.
"I'm not a big MMO guy but I'm enjoying New World. I like how straight-forward yet open-ended it is. One of my biggest turn-offs when it comes to MMOs is kind of a ""content-overload"" where it feels like there are dozens & dozens of skills, builds, loadouts, etc.. that I need to understand just to be half-way decent at the game. I can switch-up what I'm focusing on at any given moment without having to completely revaluate my characters build."
Yeah. I try to tell any low levels this. When I was leveling I never repaired a single item up until the 50s I believe. You could get a better piece for usually even less on the market
"The game has a battleground, it’s just locked to level 60"
"I would be ok with item weights if town storage space wasn't so damn small.

It's the same as my inventory FFS. I'd say it should be 5k at least. Upgradable to 10k with house and shit."
"The economy is honestly fucked.

It's too late for rollbacks."
"They will fix the exploit, but I doubt they will ban anyway. This is shaping up to be one of those games where you jump on every exploit because there isn't any bans for it."
This little maneuver is gonna cost us 51 years
"Give some decent bonus amount of Luck for flagging in pvp. At least gathering Luck so it will incentivize people to flag while going around gathering stuff but will not incentivize to go around in a big zerg.
Idk i enjoy the game only when I find other people flagged but it is happening kinda rarely. I'm lvl 39 so not so ahead of the mass but it's very rare to find other people flagged."
"all our towns were caputured with exploits. Tax is the last problem here... Game is broken, clans are broken. Exploiters ""win"", gg"
">changes were made to the Elite POIs in the end game zones

But it wasn't only end game zone bosses that were buffed from what we're seeing and what nwdb.info is showing."
"Absolutely, I feel bad for almost any Dev nowadays. 

They rarely have the control they need to put out a product that they are happy with."
Don't forget level 60s that just sit outside of places like windsward and kill anyone who wants to leave or enter.
Make bots to kill the bots
Game is so broken.
They spawn like this with just one person as well it's not abuse of dynamic spawns just how that spot works
"This is a guide on how to fish for invisible internet points on reddit.

Then maybe close it out with a meme about how you like mining more than fishing."
"Not gonna risk my 108 hrs played , I'll stick to being a poor peasant"
Well now I feel like a big goof
Inb4 players logging in and discovering that their server has just been merged into another server... that has one opposing faction controlling the entire map. Cue the epic rants! 😂
"It's all stemming from the same problem. The data changes in the game are not transactional, not validated uniquely by the server, are subject to request duplication, and too much information is owned by the client. It's a wonder someone hasn't figured out map hacks or exploits to gather resources at a distance.

This is going to require months of rewrites likely. The only thing they can do now is stem the bleeding."
At lvl 60 you will be able to Q for outpost rush which is the same or similiar I believe.
"The wonderful sounds of healers ""OH JEEEEZ"" too..."
The game needs a public test server ASAP.
Im honestly surprised they didnt quaff a potion and hide somewhere you couldnt shoot them. Then When you hop down from the rock 3 guys with greataxes show up out of nowhere and maul you.

"Well, after watching that video I downloaded twitch just to report that nob jockey."
For real I have prob 75 hours and I feel like I'm going hard. This is also working from home..I'm only 35 and still loving the game on all fronts. Not sure what is wrong with these people.
Campfires become super useful too when doing this. Im always trying to make a new camp somewhere hidden but on my way in case I die in PvP. Having to forage to build the camp adds this cool dynamic.
Either make the current rate 5-20% monthly or reduce the tax rate to 1-5%.
It's funny because they're streaming on Twitch...owned by Amazon... double ban 2ez

Those things are not mutually exclusive...
Musket needs some different bullet types or a bayonet move that has knockdown or something

Gold for what?? I didn't get anything... not surprised tho..
This is just like a Sitcom all these reddit posts. 😅
you can trade in dungeons now
This was such an oversight that my friend was thinking that it may have something to do with stopping an exploit they found while testing. Like you can do almost everything else while running but for some reason can't check inventory? There's gotta be a reason for that right.
My guess is that it'll be about as balanced as it is irl. The systems are basically the same.

Are you talking about the invasions where you defend a city at a set time or are you referring to something else?"
Save your dynasty orb until you quest in ebonscale. You'll get a 30k xp quest and another orb (pretty sure on the orb not 100%). That plus the 12k xp per repeatable dungeon quest can really add up and boost a few levels

A minimap wouldn't be needed if the compass wasn't so dogshit and broke all the time and had better clarity.

Actually something like this you can take to consumer affairs (if you are in the US). Contact your states department and they will provide you with the documents to fill out. Retaliation is not allowed under the Consumer Defense Code. A state investigator will look into it and either force them to reverse the action or issue you a refund if your claim is validated.

Yeah it's been like that forever :( had the same complaints in beta. Still having fun but it's so noticable.
Damn I just spent 20 minutes filling out a survey and actually tried. I guess I really do want this game to succeed.
Sounds fun
Whistles on my way to clock in to my mining shift. Another 10k ore today no problem. Tips the hat.
Fixed lighting issue in caves. (Players can no longer login to game)
They still need to tone it down a notch or two.
Customer support at Amazon is like fighting a 100 bots to get to an actual human employee only to find them acting like bots too. This is my experience with their services outside of the game and from what I can see it's the same here.

Instead they averaged out the ill gotten gains across the entire population to say the economy is fine and within threshold... What a joke.
Shield should have grit as passive imo.
Russian “nohomo” Company promoted by a GM? Yikes 😛
Forts should have a cool down. Respawning should have a cool down if killed in open world pvp. Trying to push a territory into state of conflict is pretty rough when the enemy faction can just respawn 30 meters away with no punishment every time you kill them.

Yeh im 44 and slowing down. Its because the quests are sending me in to lvl 50 areas now. My friends have dropped off and a lot of the quests are like go to 'x' and then ypu complete them and have to travel across the map to hand them in or do the next part. It's very tedious after a while

"I think this was terribly dishonest of them really.
Also they really do seem to want to create an ivory tower scenario regarding old players. This goes in line with them saying that they want war defenses to be successful 80% of the time.

"The problem with my server is that the largest faction (marauders) have these huge raids running around, probably 40 of them, killing everything. As a solo player I can count on 1 hand the amount of other flagged solo players I have seen. 4v1 or 5v1 is very common, 1v1 not so."
It's not just that .. even the variety of mobs are very little. There are probably 10 to 15 mobs that i've seen .. especially the skeletons and the zombie mobs.

"We just had this on Barataria. There were multiple “Gold Company” companies (numbered 1 - 4). Gold Company 1 owned Everfall and Gold Company 4 owned Windsward. 

They transferred out of the server. And as a departing middle finger to everyone set the taxes to extreme."
Changing the rules now is just breaking the game. The guys who had time to grind out the first month have gained an unattainable advantage.
This happened with the first covenant zone bought in my world. I've never seen influence bar fill up so fast. They dropped the taxes after purple declared war on them because no one would fight with them. I would rather see the entire map purple than see that company on that map ever again.

this was pointed out many times in beta when they removed any risk/reward to having separate storage. now it's just a stupid ass system that is a pain in the ass just for the sake of it.
If I were you I’d fill an entire unused towns storage with that ore. I can promise you it won’t stay that price. I’m on a crafting specialized server and I’m kicking myself for not buying these materials when they were dirt cheap. (You literally cannot lose money if the price is .01)

"Maybe the Albion Online method would be helpful here - give a bonus to xp based on faction ratios, so full factions get no bonus. Thus players are naturally drawn to the one that gives the most bonus when they are at that point, causing the factions to naturally balance better.

Of course we need new player churn for that to work, and we have artificially stale servers due to the new-player lockdown on full servers, currently, a very big problem because no one is there to buy low level stuff in the economy!"

Once a month I reckon is fair - I pay more in game than in RL on my mortgage XD
It's like the Age Of Conan launch. The first half of the game was awesome and it worked. Then you get to the part the devs didn't finish.
I personally decided to take a break from the game for a few months and give it time to even out. Got other things on my to-play list anyways.
Standart Amazon payment. Nothing to see here.
This would improve the feel of gameplay so much. Would be cool if Bow didn’t attack a varying range to the left of your crosshair based on how close they are to you. It feels so unintuitive to use.
"Very normal
For mmos the telling sign will be where it peaks up on big content updates"
My guess is they will give some sort of incentive to get people to switch and that it will be more rewarding depending on the faction ratio
"Like me. I'm I'm casual and have no idea whatsoever how to exploit anything. Usually that's just cheating. Once I start cheating (ruined Skyrim for me) it just get incredibly boring. I will never understand cheaters, and now they are ruining a game I like. Seriously.. why do it?"

I'm assuming since Amazon has made large direction changes already and since they have the resources that they don't give up on the game.  FFXIV literally shut down and started over and is doing great now.

For the time being I'm going up play something else.  ESO feels similar in mechanics at least so I'm gonna try that."

However there are people waiting to get in and play and if you have to be afk for an hour or so you really should let someone else in. Maybe logout and then login again straight away so you get the queue timer started. But yes Amazon need to get onto this ASAP and fix it."
Sounds about right. Trolls are abusing it on my server too to push political agendas lol. Wonder what dipshit at Amazon thought this was a good idea.

"What kinda weird as fuck scaling is this lol. You can clearly see that gathering xp scaling is very close to linear growth which is why its so easy to hit 200s in them.

But then crafting follows a pseudo-exponential growth accounting for the massive jumps at 50/100/150. What a strange system."
"Yeah I’m gonna play other stuff until this game gets out of its “oh shit another bug that trivializes gameplay or ruins the economy” phase.

There are some mining bots on my server but they are in an area with no mobs close enough to do this.
There's been a bot on my server spamming gold selling. He's not been auto ban despite the whole global chat reporting him. I'm not convinced there is auto Banning in this Game  Amazon said there isn't (they could be lying) but we've also seen people lie about their bans on here too

"I really enjoy New World, but it's not even close to 2004 WoW. The lore, the zones, the mob and armour diversity, the cities, the public transport, the music. WoW was probably one of the best games ever made, and completely changed gaming forever.

That said, it was pretty rough around the edges on launch too, just like New World. I'm very excited to see what they do with the game."
"Pistols would seem appropriate since there are enemies in the game already using them. I'd personally love a short range ranged choice if that makes sense. High risk, high reward. 

But the possibilities are endless. Crossbows, halberds, great swords, daggers and of course more casting weapons such as the void gauntlet."
"This fucks up the economy too. I find myself looking at the broken gear in my inventory and thinking, ""Man, I'd really like to sell this stuff, but it's so expensive to repair and I need the repair mats anyway."" Just feels like a big waste of potential."

Ban them permanently. Knowingly and continously cheating or exploiting should result in nothing else than a perma ban. He even is showing off with it.
"What makes it kinda exhausting for me is that there are only 3 real elite areas where it make sense for everyone to push their watermarks (pirates in reek, mines and myrk in shattered).  


There is nothing else where it´s making sense bc the mobs are ""low level"" with 60-63.  


Expeditions doesn´t make sense either first of bc the materials for a key are just abstractly high and second of all bc only mobs will drop higher watermarks and chests only drop around 500-515."
"I'm glad Amazon made a blog so people can quit losing their collective minds assuming nothing is happening or 24h bans only or whatever.

Instead nobody exploiting is getting away with it and all the people saying they are need to get moderated because they are full of it spreading lies and chaos and trying to gas light players for their own giggles."
"I’m annoyed thinking about the one quest line where you have to visit those 10 shrines or whatever they are, that are in a giant circle. But you can only visit two and then have to run back to the NPC to get his permission before going to the next two."

"There's a whole lot of interesting things in here, including apparently horse-related items like brindle, saddle and horse food."
So games been out what 18 days? Thats 432 hours since launch... at 360 hours that leaves 72 hours of rest at 3 hours a day. So thays 21 hours a day for 18 days.... bruh you're gonna have a heart attack before you reach 30... if you're already 30 or older might want to go see a cardiologist or something...
This should get then banned on thier streaming platform.
For those who want a simplified explanation basically the post is saying the game is designed to be server authoritative but they seem to have a number of bugs that unintentionally violate that model by relying on input from the client.
"They never banned any of the original dupers and even if they did they allow you to play the game for free with any account. So making an account,  duping then movong it thru the market isnt hard. At this point id be fine with someoen giving me void ingets as everyone I see has a full set of armor. It will take me and anyone else who didn't dupe. Months to get there."

"Poison Shot got buffed.
Direct Hit did not change.  Only the tooltip wording.

> Direct Hit - If you directly hit a target with poison shot, it deals 200% more damage > Direct Hits against targets are more powerful and deal 150% weapon damage

This is a tooltip change, the actual damage is the exact same.  The base Poison Shot does 50% weapon damage.  Direct Hit doing 200% (or 3x) a 50% attack is exactly 150% weapon damage."

They should have made it so so you can only stack so many.....not just 1.
"It’s a self fulfilling prophecy.

1.	Everfall is greatly used as a hub town starting on release day.
2.	because of this, town projects mostly focused here to get better crafting stations.
3.	Crafting stations elsewhere not as well developed
4.	because crafting stations are less developed, people choose to use everfall.
5.	Start back at #2"
Hey at least we have a counter to broken resilience now. Bug for a bug

I can’t carry these feathers because I have 4400 logs in my inventory.
"Yes and when it‘s by game design that grinding those skills doesn’t create items that are worth selling or worth something at all, people gonna loose interest in grinding even faster. It‘s just makes no sense to create items just for the grind and salvage them faster than you created them"

"Ye i agree. I dont want mounts either. I would like some public transportation system tho, like trains or small boats. Also I would want chat bubbles and /s chat and a more challenging world with more things to discover and scary monsters. 

Other than that i really enjoy how it plays so far, i hope they won't make it like retail where nothing matters"
What is a full server? Is that those servers that have character creation locked?

Sooo you can buy and sell in the white areas to avoid any excessive taxes?
Totally agree. Feels like somebody on the dev team is a sadist and just trolling their customers. They should fire whoever that is.
And that is what makes most people so frustrated I think. You can see that it has the potential to be so good but it's failure after failure...
The sound of a pickaxe pinging on an iron node in the distance will be bouncing around in my head for ages

Imagine writing negative reviews on a game because it has a longer maintenance. This act alone shows that they have no other thing to do and they are sour because it's the only thing that makes them happy and they desperately want it to be perfect because if it's not then they have to search for another game and are alone in the darkness while doing it.
the worst part is that many wars are lost on EU
"Q: Is there a potential for regional transfers to come in the future?

A: There is potential, yes, and we are working on it now. Cannot provide an ETA because it is a very different process, but when we realized we had created confusion on this, we felt we owed it to the community to find a solution.



For everyone who isn’t going to click the link"
"It will. Until you realize you'll need to gather 20k green woods or 30k pelts for a crafting level. Then your sanity will get fugged again.
And also when you'll realize that crafting armors or weapons is absolutely useless until you can craft 600 gear score and wont be useful during your own leveling."
"If you find an exploit while streaming and point it out and report it...you're doing it for research purposes. And you then don't continue to do it... Sure. But if you actively continue to do it an laugh about it? Possibly encouraging others? Yea. You're done.

In fact, it's worse than doing it repeatedly and not sharing with anyone...because you're disclosing and teaching others how to do it. You've become a source for the problems it creates to manifest further. You absolutely need to be banned."

Make sure and change to the faction you want before transferring. Made a major mistake transferring to join my friends who happen to be on a dominant opposite faction.
Welcome to destiny.
"It feels like they’re slow to react day over day but yeah relative to WoW they are reacting much faster. Big fan of the pretty decisive moves to encourage more world PvP, the WoW team would have spend 9 months pondering what to do."
"over 400 hours played, two crafts at 200 (armoring and arcana). I wouldn't suggest a wipe but if some new servers launched, and no new dupes appeared I would start on the new server. At this point, on my server if you haven't duped gold at some point you're poor."
"It does seem like a lot, income on our factions main city is 230k so far, the weekly upkeep is 110k every 7 days. If  the city is upgrading/managing stuff, then that money is being used to maintain the city."
I find this hilarious because this subreddit for the 1st week or 2 was unusable for people who wanted to mention issues or complaints with the game due to the overwhelming amount of people spamming their shitty memes to get their reddit gold.

"i crafted over 500 gloves and 500 orichalcum helmets to get armoring to 200

"Instead of full merges, they need to merge OPR queues, like all the other games."
Imo because bots bump their numbers massively. If they eliminate all the bots they loose so much player base that it would make headlines.

I can sympathize with having senior management jumping on the agile development train and just assuming that you can move forward with a garbage baseline and have developers iteratively fix it later. Managers seem to think that Agile means you don't have to put any planning or forethought into anything because clever salesmen gave them some toy examples in a training meeting.

Aaah I remember this from Age of Conan MMO. Found a bug to create infinite money and handed that over to players .. only to later find out that Funcom banned everyone with over 1g on their account.
Perfectly balanced. In fact the healer needs buffs. Hopefully the void gauntlet will allow you to kill all these people on you
"IMO something like this is by design, any game with keywords like ""faction"", ""war"", ""territory"", ""conflict between players"" etc. will 100% breed people like this."
There was a group claiming this was happening to them on my server. Turns out they've been exploiting since day one.
I'm impressed he's even still trying to play this game.
">or god forbid have different downtime for different regions across the world like any big studio.

Or like they did with the launch. That's what really boggles my mind. They decided not to do a global launch(which, I dare say, most players expected them to do), but, for some reason, the maintenance has to be global? And they can't even move it around so a different region is inconvenienced every week?"
"Oh god dammit, this the same shill OP that post everyday about how great the game is or gives it a 9.5/10. Then posted a couple days ago saying they should add mounts and bikinis and ignoring fixing the game that got 3k upvotes.

"I'm surprised to see everyone else with a similar story. I'm level 45 and I'm burnt completely out.

It's not because of the bugs though, those didn't bother me all that much, but the content loop isn't rewarding or diverse enough. It all feels pointless.

It's a fun game though and I really enjoyed getting up to level 45 but the fun has stopped, even if the bugs are fixed."
They should fix the dungeon chests aswell

* Step 4 go fishing for pearls

Now the next planed steps are:

* Step 6 go chest hunting for trophy upgrade parts

Smart people can easily avoid any consequences so damage is done."

"Saw a stream yesterday and the guy was checking out different light armors. For example a light set with 500 p.deff and a light set with 100 p.deff. He was getting the same damage from another lvl 60 player. Same goes for medium and heavy. The only thing that was changing the incoming dmg was upgrading the armor type, so from light to medium or medium to heavy. The elemental and physical armor on the equipment is straight up not working or its just the pvp scaling. He didn’t test it on mobs tho"
"So, if I understand correctly, the same people that gave us a 3 bars graph saying 98% of the gold and items duped were all taken back are the same that literally written they can't track the money they gave themselves to player so rollback was mandatory.

"This game honestly reminds me of my first time playing RuneScape. I'm getting sidetracked as I cut down trees and mine rocks and do all profession things as I'm running to an objective. Next thing I know I've forgotten the objective and I'm just farming.

Housing tax is kinda high and/or too frequent.
"Needs it owns bar like stamina, should be ""immune"" to stagger and it drains that bar, bit like when you block an attack and it drains the stamina bar, if you haven't been hit for a while it regens quickly to full, every time you get hit it should go up a % so you can't be perma staggered by 10+ mobs and escape."

My dude just needed to take a shit
And don't believe those assholes offering to trim your armor.
"On my server (El Dorado) Void Ore was selling for 3k yesterday. That means if anyone has Armoring 200 and is willing to spend 3k on an Ore piece, they could craft a piece of Voidbent in a matter of hours. I feel like people don't understand that Voidbent isn't that difficult to craft. Its much harder to craft actually good 600 GS Armor that isn't Voidbent."
"Mage Nerfs while there are STILL bugged perks too! lmao

How about we get everything working first for all classes, all specs, and all item perks too before making adjustments? That seems like a very baseline requirement before you make balance changes."
"There are BOE and BOP variants. The BOP has a guaranteed STR roll which makes rolling a usable weapon easier since you can use the charm you want. The BOE however does not have a fixed attribute, so it’s a little harder to roll a usable weapon.

If you ask me, it makes perfect sense that you should get some additional incentive for reaching 200, other then feeding other people gear."
"get local mobs to get stuck on them, they will aggro, die horribly, then you take their iroin node"
"Yup, a roadmap would be great. Amazon has something good in their hands, hopefully they don't miss this opportunity."
"Completely agree and add more PvP incentive to go with it. Instead of completely removing exp and loot, give it diminishing returns or whatever. PvP needs to be a viable way of gaining exp. It shouldn’t be the best but it also shouldn’t be pointless and just for fun."
I agree! My personal favorite is the pickaxe sound. I just cant get over how good it is!
"Yup. Outpost Rush right now is pretty much all GA/Hatchet users and heavy armor healers 

PVP is so busted right now"
Get in now before you're behind even more. Sub is a bitch fest. But even the bitches don't stop playing.

"People who immediately shit on developers for these types of things don’t have a clue how tech companies work. I have to wonder if they just imagine roaming engineers just coming on every day (at Amazon especially) and just choosing what work they do on a large scale project. 

These issues tie to leadership pushing harder on speed to market than quality of product. Guaranteed there was some type of sprint or Kanban board that some PM or Manager was responsible for maintaining."
Dudes arrogant

I don’t even know if I can keep playing. I’m also on Yggdrasil. I’ve been there since day one and all these companies exploiting has just been a huge let down.

"They'll fix it. It's just a matter of WHEN they'll fix it.

Hopefully soon.

In my opinion, heavy armor mitigation is fine. They just need to reduce damage and mobility. By a lot.

Another option is to do what archeage did. Light armor is low physical defense and high magical defense; heavy armor is high physical defense and low magical; medium armor is medium for both."
The fact that the game doesn’t have a subscription makes it feel like I’m not wasting my time doing random shit in game
"Had a dude kill me for taking ""his"" hemp so I respawned and laid in a bush a ways away and when he started going for the hemp I started firing on him and killed him. Never thought I'd shoot someone for hemp."
I'm beginning to think this is all just a *Lord of the Flies* experiment.
"They should make companies pay city upgrades and upkeep in various raw materials and goods bought at market price.

"Opens map, zooms in on wrong location, zoom out, zoom in carefully on town, locate trading post, close map, forget what direction you were facing, open map, locate trading post, mark trading post, close map, travel to trading post while staring at yellow pin on compass, do business. Hmm, now where was that cooking station?"
"My server discovered it this morning, global has been ridiculous so muted it and put up with the chat lag instead."

"There's nothing wrong with having fun with a fundamentally broken game. As long as you have fun.

Hiding your head in the sand and pretending nothing is broken is wrong.

The player count numbers speak for themselves.  Most people who have played this game have stopped playing, and it's not even by a close margin."
"Have got the same here, have verified the game files, repaired EAC, reinstalled Steam.. no fixes :l

Also tried opting out of Steam's Beta.. no change.

The Fix that allowed me access was a friend who hadn't updated their Steam sent me their dll, but haven't yet connected to a server. YMMV"
They are all great points. But the chat is my main one. I feel like I'm on my own in the game because it's just such a clunky chat system.
Way to fix this is add more gold to town board mission instead of 3G for an hours worth of work….
Sounds like silkroad online.
Damn I swear a lot on this game you got me worried
"Hopefully they start developing the game more because while fun, this doesnt seem like a long term game."

Ffxiv solved this in shadowbringers launch by just restarting the server twice a day force kicking the afkers. It worked pretty well at keeping things manageable by purging the people cheating the system.
Do your crafting somewhere else. Don’t give them your taxes.

"Following all the different threads on this topic has been entertaining. Everyone is so divided and confused and every time a dev makes a response it just gets worse. We are now down to discussing semantics on words like ""pull"" and what the devs mean by it in this context.

"I like the game but it’s repetitive as heck. Aside from the odd dungeon or Deadman’s group it’s just long runs to do the same quests over and over.

"2 issues that need immediate attention and wouldn't take much time at all to implement, yet they continue to ignore:

1. Turn off the fucking 3d video render in the queue screen. People shouldn't have to rely on 3rd party tool to not use up 90% of their GPUs sitting on queue screen.

2. Add a pity timer for reconnection. There are a lot of bugs and restarting game to better your game experience shouldn't be a decision that would severely impact you."
"Small company member here. 

The server we are on have a faction discord that we use for all the wars, and a channel for all faction company leaders to communicate and plan.

"The increased XP for trade skills is disappointing, but the PTR NWDB also shows more XP granted per item crafted:

"Issue is how dead zones are.. it's like they're all designed to have players running around.. but with a server at 500 players tops (yet still locked).. yea not happening.

Nothing after lvl 30 is really designed to be played alone as in totally solo u like the starting areas.

"Visit town board for missions everytime you visit a new town and do them passively this will help with crafting professions and when the main story sets a level requirement.

Always accept faction missions and do them if they are in the same area/direction as the main story.

"Hey, kudos to you for not hiding his name. They beg to be exposed."
"It honestly gets “worth it” at level 100.  That’s when you can reliably craft a blue with perks of your choice and GS based on your crafting level.

"And just like that, my sandbox became a litter-box."
"Brother, I’ll craft that voidbent for free. 6 ore as a payment when 1 ore is 98% of the cost confuses me. I don’t even charge people to make their gear, tips appreciated has been my model. I sincerely hope you get your stuff back or there is some repercussions to the individual.

">We corrected the bug in code the same day we learned about it, then tested to make sure nothing unintended came out of those changes, and published the fix immediately after that.

"I was thinking about this earlier, at this point it sounds insane but, add the voidbent sets to like the faction vendor or something.

Let everyone play on an even playing field with BiS gear till they sort out all the bugs/glitches/dupes.

Then hopefully the next dlc patch will increase GS and we all start grinding legitimately.  Until then let everyone enjoy, since at this point its impossible to curb this shitshow."

Man those fishing chests giving gold don’t seem so bad now…
"One thing:

The “Slow” status effect is changing from 10% slow to 50% slow. I wonder if this effects the Bow ultimate passive that applies a 10% slow when you hit leg shots.

If that’s the case, this is HUGE and may make that passive actually competitive compared to the other bow passive. Kiting a GA user by constantly hitting him with a 50% slow would be fun lol.

We shall see though."
I see their QA team tests everything as a GA build.
"Nerfing crafting and GS was a terrible choice. It’s just cemented the lead people who got in early have, and made it extremely difficult for new players to progress."
"Lots of folks in here giving you grief for the low damage numbers, but I'm certain that's a bug, not your build. Had the same issue at the Mangled Heights gate: melee was hitting for only a couple hundred damage.

">6. Most towns outside of Windsward and Everfall are a net negative investment.

Sadly that's completely true, and i suspect that it's because the game has way too little people per server. As someone who spends most of their time market flipping through multiple servers, going out of your way to different towns other than these two are usually a waste of time, save some very rare cases (that would require a lot of time researching each market price)."
Nice one :)

">We want most of the things that you can craft at a Trade Skill’s cap to be able be able to be used by players who didn’t craft those things

Then how about make it so that some of the legendary and duegon armor, aka everything that isn't praying to rng, can be traded. Right now it seems like they are trying to force poeple to max most of the crafting skills when the economy is supposedly about player trading."
I know that after this performance I will never buy a game affiliated with AGS again unless it is completely perfect on release. Even then I doubt I would buy it
"On my server everyone has realized that the exp from corruption portals is pretty OP. We also do them in huge groups, and why not flag when you're in a huge group anyways farming exp? Who would fuck with you, it's kinda free..

Really enjoy this style of communication with the community.  It would be really nice to get something like this every other week since we dont really have a roadmap and it gives us a glimpse at a slightly larger scope of what they've been working on outside of the horrendous daily bugs/exploits we learn about.

"The 600 gear isn't rewarding because farming wm isn't hard or rare, it's juste timegated"
"Most of pve elements of this game were added last.
They feel forced and unpolished because they are exactly that.
As a PvE player I'm excited about devs taking they want to develop pve aspect of the game in the future.
Hopefully this game will have something more to offer then three decent dungeons in terms of PvE. Even more mob variation (not just reskins) and more interesting elites would improve feeling of this game."
In regards to your comments: if someone tells you to kill yourself report them for harrasment.
">thinks that high exp requirements for skills and levels are content 

I'm not even complaining about endgame, but this is simply wrong."
"The entire meta of the game revolves around figuring out what to exploit and abuse. 

Currently the best gems, weapon perks, armor perks, farming routes, watermarking, weapon skills, are the best because they're all bugged. Can't wait to see the exploits in outpost rush in the coming weeks."
Hatchet bug works fine with a dex build.  You can also do permanent haste with a musket.
PSA: The muskets roll is terribly short so swap weapons before rolling away. this is also why every other roll seems to be short when your animation cancelling your roll. You have your musket out for the first and then away for the second roll.
This is because the children using great axe to kill people with left click are running onyx gems for physical damage reduction so they don't get blow up by op greataxes and warhammers  and then get mad that magic weapons hurt them with their 0% elemental damage reduction.
Elite zerg runs are going to get bloody
I had the same issue last night at Skysong. I was at lvl 57 and my husband came on his level 60 to help. We barely could make a dent in the bosses and they were hitting us hard. He said a few weeks ago (at lvl 60) he could solo them. This is a side quest and shouldn’t be this hard. Not sure if it’s intentional or a bug.
"Yep thats what empty server brings you. I just transfered from empty to full since i also had nothing to do. Im pvp oriented, having no oprs or outworld pvp made the game boring. Now i hope on new server that will change.

I hope merges or second transfer roll out soon so you can have fun again"
"Can't amazon just have someone walking around in-game, seeing this shit, and banning them?"
"People have been abusing the report system to get key players banned for wars, battles, etc. it’s something that can’t be helped at the player level."
"Lvl 56 or so now, so I probably still have a good week or 2 or 3 going to get to 60 + to farm good gear. After that I dunno. Maybe they release new content, maybe not. I got my moneys worth out of it already, everything else is a bonus."
I'm more impressed by the person in chat asking for a membership fee to use the trading post.

"Yep, me. Level 47 and playing much less than before.

I bought the game ""late"" (like 2 weeks after launch) cause a bunch of friends were playing.

Never tried betas or watched content about it, It got me addicted for like 10 days straight. Now I'm taking it slowly, since even if I hit 60 I'll have to wait for my friends.

I was also trying to powerlevel the professions, now that I'm around 130/200 on crafting and 170/200 on gatherings I'm slowing that down too since when you hit 60 you can farm faster"
"I agree, but you’re a couple years too late"
"Im slowly realizing being on a subreddit for a game I like isnt a good idea anymore, I'd rather be ignorant to the negativity"
"well idk about you man but an MMO needs a happy community, if not the case, some people quit, some other people notice it, feel the game emptier, gets bored, quit aswell and then another gen of people will notice again. That's not something you want in an MMO..."
What make it worse is  dead server is even more dead because of this patch
Yes this is the angry dungeon master syndrome.
"Or add literally any feature from an MMO with actual guild features to the game.    
\- Shared storage    
\- Donation bins for the public    
\- Guild hall with separate trophy slots, company only recall point"
Well. They are in trouble. But this is sad because i think they are working without any rest.
The armor design in this game does a really good job bordering tasteful and typical MMO fantasy. Very cool.
"How about just making salvage give you reasonable gold return. The repair salvage system is absolutely atrocious. I have 2000 repair parts at all times. If i repair something it costs 3 repair parts and 20 gold. If i salvage an equal piece of gear i get 3 repair parts and .05 coins. What the fuck?

Game drops me an epic tank sword, I'm a healer, I have no use for it, it's bind on pickup, what are my options? Salvage an epic sword for .75 coins. 3/4ths of 1 coin. Nice amazon. Real nice."
Already time to throw the tea into the bay?
"330 dex light armor and I am in Outpost Rush hitting people for 500 lol. I just went back to hammer / greataxe. Why would I play that build, I'm useless."
"I'm currently running a 22.9lb medium build with a bow/rapier. I get completely demolished in Outpost Rush by hatchet users ,Warhammers, and great axes. I feel like i've hit them 10x more then they hit me. Maybe 2 or 3 swings then im dead?! lol. Also feel like bow shots in PVP just look and FEEL like little stings to the enemy team which i think should deal a bit more damage."
His mansion and furniture analogy was spot on.
"I get that they wanted more engaging combat, and I think they achieved it in a lot of areas. But stagger is just not fun. That combined with body-blocking makes it just dumb. 

The worst experience were the dryads. The melee dudes with infinite stamina and ability to literally change direction mid-leap for a staggering slam? Fuck that."
"Rather than ban duper’s, half the legit players have quit the game including myself. GG Amazon"
"""Your currently have the wrong weapon"". Did Amazon accidentally order a Chinese counterfeit dev team from Amazon?"
Why is syndicate so popular? Streamers and such or what?
"What are you talking about there is enough scaling atm. I win lvl 50-60 as lvl 42. 

They should focus on more PvP incentives/Rated content instead of finetuning scaling even more."
"Yeah this isn't a bug, it's just how the damage calculator works, for better or for worse. Your findings seem to be consistent with the expected calculator (except for the 300int perk, which looks like it's only a 10% increase).


Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/aOAA9lF-Ybs) for a breakdown on damage calculation. It will explain damage much more thoroughly than anyone else in this thread."
"So epic. Thanks for sharing! These are the experiences that makes NW so unique and memorable. :) Good shit, man."
or maybe when you hit 20 on a weapon you can just have 2 specs to toggle between on that weapon
Imo running through starter zones with the explicit purpose of killing low level players is kinda shitty. If they’re doing pvp missions it’s fair game though.
"Now that you are 60 you have unlocked New World's main endgame activity which is ""Bitching""."
"Well, the game is in a shitty state and the higher level you get, the more you feel it. All those positive rose red glasses wearing Andy’s are just level 40-50 and have stuff to do."
"I'm baffled how this kind of bug is even possible. Servers know how to keep time... have for decades. Reliably. It gets only hard if you need millisecond-level accuracy (ie. server time synced to external super-accurate source). If one second accuracy is enough, that is trivial."
"What if you don’t use chat? Can they still ban you?

Wondering how they are picking people to ban, is it by seeing people in chat? 

What if you stick to faction chat only?"
This post is prove that you have no fucking clue what you talking about. MMOs lvling Content can never ever be its only content. An mmo needs endgame content or it will inevitably fail like it happend to so many before. This is the number 1 reason why modern MMOs die 2 months after release. Lack of content.
Everyone other than sparks is bad
"Dude I am *so* suspicious of the glut of memes pushing the ""sweaty nerds no-lifed New World for two weeks"" narrative seemingly being employed as a catch-all defense against critique of this game. There are so many completely valid complaints getting drowned out by this shit, some iteration of which is an almost permanent fixture at the top of the sub at this point."
Lol this is awesome. Can already tell this dude is just a pathological liar. 300K followers yet is “new to streaming.” Give me a break
Where? Gratz btw
"Great list that I'm sure will help someone 

If i could add one thing it would be the daily quest bonus which give 10x gold for 3 quests a day."
"I have the exact same feeling. I mainly play this game for the crafting, economy, and PvP. With duping I lose 2/3 of what I enjoy instantly. The yacht expression is a perfect ~~anecdote~~ metaphor.

\-edit: word - thanks for the correction"
Tanks should FEEL like tanks.  So yes I agree.
"Monkeynews is being mad that we farm Malevolence with them and got his company to mass report me within 2 minutes of threatening it. 

I bet there was an AGS employee ready to check the not so automated ban ;)"
It's always a good strategy to shit on healers.... 😰😰😰😰😭😭😭😭😰😰😰😭
"New world is essentially an early access game, it’s very well polished and has a great start but theres a lot of qol and other features required to have real staying power but the sheer amount of devs amazon has hired is showing ambition."
They just need some GMs to fly around handing out permanent bans to the bots.
Tell me you have a mental illness without saying you have a mental illness
There will be no rollback.
Not a secret for Beta players... Those are bugs reported back in closed.
Idk what's more unbalanced. Him perma-stunning you or you tanking it without breaking a sweat.
I'm happy they increased the faction token caps. Let's me save up some more so I can buy multiple pieces of faction armor as soon as I'm a high enough level for it.
"But it makes sense you can carry 20 weapons, and 30 armor pieces. They are probably stack so close to each other that they damage themselves due friction."
"Bro...you don't have to explain or be ashamed of why you have played 500 hours.  How you spend your time is no one's fucking business but your own.. Fuck anyone who says otherwise.  

&#x200B;

That being said I agree more could have been done to those guys who were pretty clearly duping.....I know there was some bleeding into accounts that had nothing to do with it but, some of them are just blatantly enjoying the spoils of that shit."
"My name is Barry Allen, and I'm the fast"
I thought rain of arrows was pretty under powered already. Like completely useless in pvp. Not sure about that change.
"98% of duped items/gold isn't in the game anymore. If this is accurate, it's pretty good."

"Bruhh i'm in bed already, just in time.I wonder what happens if we get new zone or any other new content,1 week downtime and extended 3 days?"
PVP only?
Everfall makes 400k a week and can close portals. How sad they didn't spread the wealth
"Why would you want to play on this server?

I guess if you just wanna farm all day, everyday, forever, then i guess your happy?"
10 gold and I’m taking all the risk here
they never addressed any bugs from any of the alphas
When an MMO can simulate urban decay.
I have had two 24 hour bans for this… gotta be nice words in chat i guess … wasn’t even being mean to a person. more like “ah fuck i died”
"""Sometimes if you face your character looking up and melee, and you look up into their asshole and swing at them, it will cause your attacks to hit. And the only thing that costs you is your sanity."""

"Yeah it gets to a point where running far to get 1k exp from a loot 5 chests zone whose enemies that spawn there are on a 20 second respawn timer and all of them get agro to you as soon as you enter which means you have 3 people shooting at you plus the 5 that are staggering you out of every ability... I should stop. 

I get on every day to do my daily faction quests and fill me rested exp every other day.

"My Ryzen 5 5600x runs pretty hot in New World as well, but I've never seen my cpu temp go past 85c.

If my CPU was nearing 100c I'd look into reapplying thermal paste and getting a new cooler."
30% is ridiculously high.  That is more than the value of a full gathering luck set.
Probably wouldn't be so many negative reviews if the game wasn't a dumpster fire right now.
How is lowering taxes connected to gold dupes?
" that happens When you disable the main gold making method for more than 2 days, and if like people are saying the market is not going to be avaliable until monday cause of thanksgiving then congratulations to us filthy europeans for not being able to gather materials without being overcumbered or wasting azoth."
"As much as I like the idea of using your house and strategizing storage... It's just a massive pain in the ass. I agree to make it all one and each settlement you discover adds 1,000 weight plus whatever add ons you get from area rep."
"Sells 700k copies before launch, gives us 250k slots on servers global for launch day. What were they thinking. Now they blaming players for wanting to play the game and not fight the login boss. Increase the server size by double and GG. Implement a DC protection system. Fix lag in dungeons."
This just looks like auto running unless I’m mistaken. Auto run does not avoid the disconnect for afk. They would have to be using a macro to jump/attack or something. I saw someone on my route botting for at least 3 hours for the same two iron nodes. To me that is a much bigger problem.
"I see the equivalent of this in global chat daily... after their wait to even enter the server, ironically"
"The only sound I absolutely hate is that weird ""bonk"" when hitting ghosts."
At least I will be able to pet Barkimedes without my camera shaking soon.
Closing in on the 30s was when I start noticing they getting lazy and voice dub only the first line instead of the entire dialog.
"Nope those tubing Orbs.. even Amrine require such a stupid amount of materials that you will be 10 lvls ahead of the dungeon before you can make a single one.

It gets worse with each higher expedition needing basically an orb worth of materials from previous expedition..

They should cut the material cost by like 10x to make it barrable. Still won't be worth it probably."
"They legit trying to gaslight us:“However at no time are the clients making decisions or “freezing” characters in place - if character are frozen it is because the client is behind on drawing, but the server simulation continues.”We've seen the videos and proof...

"At least our rapier is getting buffs, maybe we will actually be able to burst people down before they breathe on us and kill us.

"One say soon this game is going to be only bots gathering crafting materials, bots fishing, bots doing pvp missions, bots taking towns, etc.  Humans need not apply."
3k servers the dream. I always get around a 1k q trying to log in so that might help a ton.
Hallelujah! I spend 10 minutes trying to find why this is not possible. So much wasted screen space and difficult to read. Please let us adjust the chat (also into multiple areas)
"it kinda bothers me that npcs are almost nonexistent in this game. they're relying too much on players to make towns feel populated, but go to a place like first light and you start to see how abandoned places feel. a game like black desert online has constant streams of random npcs walking around and travelling. they need to add that when the player base dies down a little."
"1. Make global names for the purpose of easy server transfers/ merges

"Well I'm level 58 and have been power leveling. Got kicked out of two invasions last night cause I wasn't 60 or in their company.

Soooo, pvp or the PvE events doesn't really happen till 60, not 50. And if your in the territory's company."
"Armor is limited to 1 skill perk per piece. 

What do they mean by this exactly?"
And my guild owning First light attacking King today is now collecting guild taxes 1k from every member every week to have enough Money to Pay Upgrades and wars etc because yeah those dont get enough taxes
Imagine how much better this would look if everything in this game was as polished as we all know it could be/hopefully will be in the future.

Lol no they shouldn't give us a compensation. Not again please.
"ive been complaining about this since the release, if any good player knows, its hard to aoe with melee, and a good fix for this issue is diminishing returns (stagger doesnt apply for a certain time or after a certain amount of hits)"

Very good write up.

"I was thinking the same exact thing. I am not sure why Travel, Weapon Respeccing & Crafting is tied into Azoth with a small cap of 1000. This doesnt make sense, I understand for Crafting and travelling but doesnt work for all 3 with such a small cap. I honestly think they missed a ""0"" on the 1000cap. I think it should have been 10000 cap or change the it to gold instead. Have a static amount such as 100g for each respec similar to attributes respeccing."

"320 hours into the game, I crafted 2 pieces all by myself, and one piece I actually bought a surprisingly low price ingot for 7k. I have 30k orichalcum ore in storage to prove my grind if necessary..."
"Conflicted. Agree with design philosophy but, especially when gathering, I'm frequently referencing a second monitor for efficient farming. If we want to get away from that behavior, how?"
What about the solo players? Fuck solo players. Basically how it feels. Lol I’ve helped so many people with the lower tier bosses and now those bosses take so long to kill I don’t have the energy. I fought the 65 bear I used to solo no problem and realized after 5 mins I’d barely done 10% damage and I just ran off and gave up. Everything is well guardian. It’s boring.

"This was never ment to be a traditional mmo, it was a rust like fantasy mmo lite with full loot pvp and player built structures, but they did a one eighty 12 months ago and then bandaided current systems to fit a traditional mmo, thats why the servers are small and nothing feels polished.

Edit: I was misinformed, it was 29 months ago, still way too little time to develop a AAA MMO"

"Ah, AGS already launched the announced Wintersday event, nice!"
"I get it, as someone who played in Alpha we were all made aware, I posted it in my global chat like 2xs a day. There are 300 Town Cards for each settlement just have to grind boards for the rest of your days and eventually you'll be maxed everything. Also unless they changed it from alpha you can only get 400 storage from cards. So even if you fucked up early on you'll still get your storage bonuses later."
The first starting areas are very basic. The 30 and up zones are awesome and way more diverse looking. Quests are very basic and I hope they improve on them
The most surprising part of this post is that you manage to actually sell weapons on the market

"I absolutely love the Hood on that “Rogue” skin. “Wizard” rove is dope too. Would love to mix and match them!

Logged out"
Actually i dont mind the grind but it is just not fair anymore since everybody whos skill was at 200 before the nerf has a huge advantage now. Saved money and time.
Be careful with what you do with resources you find early. Certain herbs and rare resources can drop to you early and if you aren’t careful you can waste them.
"Between work, pets, dinner, house chores, and exercise, I barely get in an hour per day.

Whats worse is that currently the US East servers are up while all the EU servers are still down. They put on twitter that they have to increase the downtime for EU servers with no ETA.
"Patch 1.0.3

“Dear adventurers, we need to extend our maintenance for EU Central. The estimated downtime is approximately 6 days.

We apologize for the inconvenience. We will see you in Aeternum next week.”"
I can’t agree more with the need for a PvP incentive system. This would be an easier change than adding a new game mode and would make PvP better and scalable with future content. Eventually I’d like to see a small scale arena game mode like 5v5 with a competitive ladder and rewards that reflect how well you do.
This is worrying
this is an exploit not a build. I hope your reported them

Draw them all in.

Drop the heal so I can out heal the damage.

Use Beserk so I don't get knocked back.

And then smash those abilities with a combination of few light attacks first/after to get as many hits in as possible."
this is the most negative I've felt about the game since release.
This is the literal only reason I don't run full AoE spells and have a single target heal.
Interesting that our low pop server has these problems.  Cant imagine the shenanigans going on over in the high pop servers.
SO THAT'S WHY I HAD TWO HEALING PASSIVES STACK TOGETHER. OMG. I thought it was normal.

"You have to level almost every profession and the game design is about changing weapon and switching stats as there are no classes or jobs.

"I can attest that there is some sort of anti-farming code. I fish A LOT, and if I'm fishing the same 2 hotspots for too long, they start respawning much slower than the normal time allotted for secret spots.

I can respect the design philosophy behind this as I do feel there is enough variety in the zone design to know where certain resources are after you explore and start acknowledging relative landmarks in each space"
Having completly isolated servers that are capped to 2250? max players is simply a bad implementation. The game should be able to automatically balance the player's load within a world set.
Use fire pillar on enemy. Fire pillar gets cast on me.
"When some of these reports are as detailed as ""I'm pretty sure I duped items during a trade but I'm not 100% sure they actually duplicated and also I have no idea how I did it except that trading was probably involved but maybe not"", I have no doubt they should all be absolutely believed with total certainty and we should assume the game is doomed."

"I’m curious if the Azoth cap and higher travel costs are incentive to consistently farm corruption portals. 

I’m not saying I like the cap or expensive fast travel. I really don’t. But I’m just speculating. Though my thoughts might be a bit naive, because the reasons might not even be that deep at all lmao."
Don't think they realise that people just won't want to play (myself included) if the only method of pvp is great axe and hammer combo. I don't want to melee so I guess I don't want to play
"Just take a break.  I'm currently playing other games until my server merges... Then I'll try again.  The past week I've been running around the 51 - 60 zones solo. Pvp flagged, and literally never see anyone outside of towns.  ... And the towns themselves are usually empty too."
"Despite what reddit looks like right now, this game offers hundreds if hours of game play. It has some bugs and some issues, but it's a lot of fun. If you're fine with an imperfect game, I'd recommend it."
"All of us. Every single one of us. Would leave a positive steam review at lvl 22. 

And thats what happened."
"This is something world of warcraft has always done well for story campaigns. You move throughout a zone slowly filling out the region. You never really have to travel far to the next area for questing. 

New world having you go to the far east side of the map to then go back to the fort in Brightwood is insane. Or the constant back and forth between the fishing spot in Windsward."

I'm actually glad I got lucky with my server. It's 4-4-3 with yellow being the 3.  Server seems balanced as far as factions go.  It'll be enteresting come 4months from now when the faction changes are available

How about after they merger servers they start one or 2 new servers for poeple that want to start from scratch and disallow character transfers to those servers. Would that solve the problem and make everyone happy?

Congratulations 🥳
"To be fair, Amazon is combating bots very aggressively, just in a non-obvious indirect way. Since soon all the legitimate players will leave due to frustration, there will be no point for bots to farm resources anymore-"
"Shouldn't it be ""all group members', not member's?"
When AGS starts to allow free transfers between servers you can expect your server to be left with syndicate only. I would predict the top pvp guilds also transferring or switching sides when boredom hits.

"I thought they did revert pvp scaling? I also think damage done heavily has to do with armour bonuses, I fought a lvl 50 on my 34 with a rapier and i chunked him for 1600 with a backstab heavy and killed him in 2-3 seconds. He was all light armour. Well I’ve also fought level 20s and killed them way slower because of heavy armour or doing the proper. Heavy head, heavy chest, medium gloves, medium boots, and light pants

I do 100% agree on the rewards though, feels bad to have a great duel to get nothing."

"True but AGS seems to have too much to listen to. Like most companies AGS follows statistics.

Be in the numbers if you're satisfied with AGS.

"Really? 2-5 days after launch, there was NO server in EU with a queue less than 2000. Many of us had to move to US servers. And many did after the announcement of character transfers.

"Welp that’s definitive proof right there. Looks like Amazon games studio is more fucked than the people who shorted GameStop are. 

Only possible thing I can think of it to remove windowed mode, which would be ridiculous but otherwise they would have to do a complete overhaul of how the game detects client-server side interactions."
so we should see void ore for sale for around 50 gold soon?
Agree with everything you said. I hadn't heard about the Penetrating Shot nerf and it saddens me. Life is already difficult as a bow user and they are only increasing the gap.

They could close this game right now. Start advertising for New World 2 in 6 months and promise to fix everything and we’d all pay another $40 for it. We were the marks."

"""worst ive ever seen on reddit""

you must be new to MMO subreddits?"
"It still is casual friendly. Buy a T1 or T2 house and only pay taxes when you want to use it. T1 house taxes are super cheap. You get the gold from that just by playing a few Outpost Rushes during the week. 


Since you don't have to pay back taxes, you can pay as much or as little as you want. The more hardcore gamers would be the ones buying multiple T3 or T4 houses and will be paying much more every 7 days."
This has happened twice now on my server. Once in Everfall (WW trade hub) and now again in MD. I think it’s petty and funny at the same time.

"I mean if you already have 12 friends why not try to take over a company yourselves?  It'll be hard but if you want the full experience, surely a hostile takeover is in the vision"

Magic is so broken at this moment that basically everyone is using melee
No just fix the reciliance perk and we all do 20% more damage

Indeed.  It's an incredible bargain compare to say WOW where you pay for the game & upwards of $180/year to play it.
So many streamers are self-important fuckwits.

"Hate the ranged DPS who aggro shit before the tank, then while I'm throwing down the heals for the tank because he's got most of the mobs, they bolt across the room away from the heals and the tank, and just die in some sad corner without eating a pot or food."
"New York has so much income, how is it fair for other cities??"
"That’s insane, I always wonder how people find exploits like this, I mean are there that many loopholes in the game to do stuff like this?"
They shouldn’t have banned cheaters. They should have given them permanent encumbrance status and a “I suck life” title
"Also, but then what? 

So you spend countless hours killing or zerging through the same location and you hit that magical 600 water mark. So what now?"
AGS just hoping this blows over and we forget about it… so don’t let it blow over and don’t forget about it! They royally fucked up and we deserve compensation.

"Regarding transmogs, I feel there's a balance that could be struck such as only allowing transmogs to apply to similarly classed armor/weapons. i.e. no light armor transmogs applied to heavy armor. That way opponents still have a sense of the armor class equipped.

Alternatively, they could also nullify transmog rendering for opposing faction players when flagged for PvP."
"The game is alright but I like playing new mmo with my friends, also the buy to play feature is nice, less commitments."

I'd be down for having a PVE and PVP preset to choose between without cost.

They mention a 'token'. Does that mean we can just save our free transfer and use it 1 or 2 months down the line when you want to?
"You forgot: change pvp faction quests. (Running in circles is deathly dull.) Tie the quests in with some pve mobs and interesting control points/structures. Give lower levels different tasks to counter lvl disparity issues.

Would like more updates to the trading outpost. Selling items is a pain.
"V nice, do more of these"
"Welcome to the club.

This game gives me an ""I live here now"" feeling, that I haven't had in a game since UO."
"Very well said.  I feel the same way - the game is about which team knows about more bugs to abuse or can abuse them more quickly.

There are no tactics. There are no outplays.  There is no subterfuge, no intrigue, no hard encounters, no teamplay, no ambushes. There's not even an economy (literally) at this point.

The game is over for me as well for awhile.  A ""game"" that is about which side can abuse the most bugs the fastest is not a game to me - it's completely asinine."
Hope its perma bans

"They released an arguably unfinished game, yes.

Therefore no. They will not stop releasing unfinished games.

Companies will stop releasing unfinished products IF AND ONLY IF they loose money from said action. This is the sad reality unfortunately.

"I agree we need more pvp scaling BUT it's fair to say nowadays the scaling is a thing. Being level 18 i defeated a guy level 25 in a quite fair battle.

The idea, ofc, is to be able to compete with a level 60 but compared with Open beta scaling at least we have something."

That said its still an amazing game"

"Honestly the community and more important the devs should take the criticism seriously. Started playing the game with 10 friends, grinded up to lvl 30/40, but I haven't seen anyone online the past few days.

Nice."
Man reading this thread made me sad. I have a lot less hope in this game after reading comments from all the cheaters. Damn. People really are ruining this game. We almost had a good community.
You know all the people in here saying mage will be fine or the nerf is needed are GA/WH players 100%

"Why every 5 days though? Why not just weekly? Just seems stupid,  your rent is due a different day of the week every time."
Tip 8 about the GPU usage is a huge one. It seems like whenever I look up I drop by 1/2 my frames. Makes fighting in the numerous obelisks almost impossible.
"Solo?  No one fed you materials?

I find it hard to believe, honestly.

You either bought gold and bought mats off AH or you had friends funneling you mats. Period."
"Musket just isn't good enough, at all, it need to be made better for other than hunting too. Make powder burn AoE hit, make the grenade instant proximity detonation, make bear trap add a 10 second bleed on the enemy etc, very easy fixes to start with improving it.

Hunting is the only thing it's good for currently. You can stand at the edge of hunting ground and just pull everything to you from miles away and wait for the finishing shot until they are at your feet."
They won’t. The economy is far beyond saving at this point.
I'm still not letting Overwolf anywhere near my computer 👍🏽
"Seems I have unintentionally started a huge argument here, I just wanted to share this as I thought it was good by Amazon Games/Steam lol.

"With server transfers coming, this server will be dead within a month. Majority of Green and Purp will transfer off, taking with them any PvP that was left on this server.

"Yeah it is and the solution I find for this; always roll (or heavy-medium dodge) before weapon switching. Press weapon switch right after you roll or a bit delayed, your character switches the weapon instantly all the time and it also removes recovery animation of the roll so win-win. This is a good, reliable method. If you try switching any other way, its very inconsistent and rage inducing."
I don't know why the devs think it's a good idea to have some ridiculous house tax and they don't give end game players a steady source of income. Everyone told me to save for the big house but i ain't paying 2k every 5 days to just get the perks without any good incomes.

"There is faaaaaar too many issues. But even theoretically, if you don't take the bugs into account, the game just isn't very fun once you hit 60. No one wants to farm chests for 6 months to do watermark, no one wants to spend a day farming to make a key to run a dungeon. 

It's just a badly designed game, intentionally making you do super boring stuff to artificially slow you down because there is no content."

Makes for a forced variety

My 2 cents"
"It does seem more expensive on some now, I’ve noticed the increase cost too as it seems to have gone up, I assumed it was due to levelling though

I am not for mounts though surprisingly I’m more for lowering those costs or making it free initially and a cost of doing it within a few hours"

Bezos is just using the game to get players to test his own tax evasion schemes at this point.
"Imo selling overpriced items is just as dumb and easy to find. Just:

1. Dupe gold
2. If your company owns a territory tell them to raise taxes
3. Just spend gold buying random items on AH

Tax money will be legit and clean, without any direct connection to you. AGS would have to reverse all AH trades you made and take away money from hundreds of innocent people or do nothing."

Yeah this GA thing reminds me of bright wizards in Warhammer. I think they finally toned them down just in time for the game to shutter.
"The only changes they have publicly indicated that they are going to change are the flesh wall HP in places like Scorp or Maw, some Ebonscale NPC elite overscaling, and the elite chest issue (which they claim were all unintended).  

Which is unfortunate, because Myrk is 100% dead on my server in terms of player activity and people are bored and no one runs dungeons because they dont want to waste an expensive orb."

"It’s a 40 dollar game with an easy 200 hours of content. I don’t know if I’d pick it up to play solo. But if you have ANYONE to level with, it’s an easy purchase."
"the downside is the ""combat"" tag dropping off while someone runs, getting a burst of speed, causing inconsistent speeds as people drop in and out of combat. People running is already a huge annoyance when it comes to pvp. Now maybe when you're not flagged, I could see a lack of downsides, but then it gives a buff to being unflagged, further reducing the desire for people to flag up outside of pvp missions."
Capitalism is when purple man take zone from green man and raise taxes
Is it possible to post your builds? I'm running Musket / Rapier as well!
Same reason the pvp scene is struggling in BDO. Gear/level diff really hurt more than help the pvp. It's takes the skill away when there aren't level playing fields. I guess there's always shooters though :(

The game isn’t perfect, but it’s not as bad as some make it out to be…"
"One day MMO developers will learn that paying to change your skills is something that just isn't fun. Let people experiment. A lot of games make this mistake early on and then eventually end up making it free anyway. As far as I can see the game needs gold inputs more than it needs outputs anyway. Especially if you don't want to PvP.

But as others have said. This could easily be Amazon creating a problem that they can sell you the solution to. Time will tell."

"Would at least like a developer response on the **glaring** issue of territory war PVP basically on its way to being monopolized by a few big companies on each server.  A major part of the PVP experience is going to end up being exclusive to people in the primary companies, and even then only the top 50 of those companies.

I can definitely seeing the feeling of being 'excluded' from this content causing a lot of players to end up leaving the game after they hit level cap."
I had a rapier drop for me with 0.85% dmg done to gain back as health so it’s totally possible to incorporate in the build you want to play. Nice reflexes the first dodge was nice.

"Honestly a little upsetting I missed the window. Put the game down so I didnt burn out while waiting to play with friends, and I've really enjoyed some other games in the meantime. Getting hit with a second delay is just killing what little momentum this game had for me."
Did they warn you about it first? They should have done that at least. Or made it where  you cant trade in person at least for a while before they ban you. If not then that's shitty. I'd appeal again saying you were never told and the rules doesn't say anything about gambling and that they should also announce to EVERYONE  that's dice gambling isn't allowed. Good luck!
"I don't care if it's significantly harder, I care if it's any harder. If it's any harder that's a problem, and from what I'm seeing the increase in needed xp is not matched by the increased xp gained, if that's the case I think people are justifiably furious.

If Arcana is significantly different on the PTR that's fine for it, but I'm not hearing of similar changes to engineering, weaponsmithing, armoring, or furnishing."

I love all these points. Also have them fix the glitch that removes food buff when you enter OPR. I hate how I have to reapply it every time. Complete waste of resources.

Especially the expensive 35min food in which half goes to waste.

"Well, there are a lot of people in this thread who just don't understand what you're saying.  I completely agree with you. It doesn't matter how great you are at dodging or blocking, if you backward three or four mobs -  which is highly likely because this game's respawn system is still set at an obnoxiously high rate,  As if they're expecting launch day population still.

Once one of those three or four mobs hit you, you will get chain CC'd."

I didn’t care about any of the other issues and problems and down time because playing the game was rewarding regardless. Now it’s Anthem. Why the fuck should I play and see nothing for it? I’ll see ya’ll in a week or two. Happy Thanksgiving!"
"I wanted to get to 200 armoring, gonna get to 150 and after that idk, the mats needed are ludicrous."
Because of bad game design. Literally that is the only reason.
"Go to mourningdale, south of town there is a patch with a sht ton of Buffalo, silk, and hemp. Farm that and fill your bags a few times. Use that material to make everything you need for infused leather/infused silk gloves. Just finished leveling armoring and this went great and was cheap"
Or the fact that they are radio silence on everything.
"85% of players have gone.

"Reporting should never be used as evidence of wrong doing. It should be used to help anti cheat, AI, and humans jump in and inspect the situation closer.  

I've been an adamant defender of the game, but the decision to actually use reports as enforcement is penny pinching as the expense of all of us."
"I've definitely gotten my $40 worth. Due to the lack of subscription, I can just take a break now guilt free and come back another time.

"Check this guys post history in this sub, posts multiple times a day, praising the game to an absurd standard and bashing anyone who has criticisms, legitimate or not. For someone that is so active on reddit, only has 1 post in his history non new world related and I scrolled for ages and all comments on new world as well. 

I love people making stuff and posts like this, but come on… seriously?"
So trading post is toast?
How much asmodeum did it take to finally craft that?
"I literally just did this yesterday with five people.

Have to say it was a nightmare and I hate whoever made the quest / area / boss. Huge boss in a small area with blight, hits pretty hard, AOE attack that fills half the room.

The worst part though is all the stupid tree roots you can get stuck on in there. At one point got stuck between a ""Y"" shaped root and the boss's legs. Completely immobilized and no option other than to face tank hits for a good minute."

Join them! Level up some other weapons.  Where’s this on the map?
"After getting to lvl 30, I agree. I often just get exhausted playing since it's 90% just me running huge distances for quests I have done many times before.

I am sure even with many great updates, the game's foundation with how it treats it's quests will likely remain the same. Luckily, I enjoy it still so it ain't much of a problem for me."
Kay Pacha! I play on the same server and for Marauders. I knew we were doomed on day 1 when purple got their first town and everyone immediately chose Syndicate. Is your screenshot the update after tonights wars? So sad to see :(
There is zero fucking chance ill ever make a new character in this game. Holy shit the grind.

"I made a post on the forums about this and linked to this video so they can see it, hopefully this is addressed asap for obvious reasons.

Void gauntlet for life. Have been excited for this since day 1.
Does it still have the same time gated limited on crafting them?

GAxe is the only melee weapon where you can go at same speed as a running person while attacking so... yeah it's mandatory for melee players.

"So I've only off healed the dungeon, and am not a life staff main, but it seems like you should be constantly hitting light attacks to lower the cool down of your spells"
The pastor Marshall thing was wild. Dozens of folks would set up an auto attack macro and leave their characters farming overnight. To think people were worried about xp potions when they had free versions built in.
I actually think the pvp scaling is in a good spot. I'm level 30 and can win fights against 36-38's. I like that. Level 40+ will kill me but it would still be a decent fight and one i could win if the level 40 is real bad. I don't mind this system at all. Makes gear score relevant but not by a large margin unless you're 15+ levels higher.
All 3 factions in our server is balanced so we dont really have any issues for now. Hopefully it stays that way.
"Number 7 is a huge issue for me.

I haven't played more than an hour or 2 the last few days because I absolutely hate this playstyle. I don't mind grinding the area too bad. It's boring but I've done worse. I hate spending 90% of my time in luck gear and looting boxed once every 24 hours. It's boring and unengaging. I honestly can't convince myself to do it again tonight."
Turning on the blender is a lovely strat
For real dude so many whiners pointing out problems the game has. Can we just go back to pictures of sunbeams through trees and screenshots of “my first bag craft”
Just fix the damn ice gauntlet
Nice! Now you just need a flawed int gem and 250int 150dex to get the most bang out of it. Or 300/100 for the extra full heath dps.
Hopefully they balance the musket to actually be viable in more content. It’s pretty lack luster compared to other ranged weapons.

"Adlivin is 10 Cov - 1 Syn - 0 Mard

Used to be a full server and now it feels dead. Low pop most of the time, barely med at peak. Why anyone would want to stack a faction just to play MS Paint simulator is beyond me."
Who said 2 weeks? Genuinely curious what it will look like when the majority hits level 60 though.
Not only this but the fact that they see you from 50 feet away and then chase you for an entire year before they get tired and go back.
I can't even get to 150 on any of my crafting skills because the amount of mats I need just takes ups soooo much of my time. this is impressive.
"I play every day. When I'm at work, I want to be home playing. When I'm at the gym, I want to be playing. I would have so many hours in if I didn't have a life lol.
I love the game. No game is perfect, especially a launch mmo, but this game is great. In a month or 2 When all the complaints everyone overreacts about now are gone, it will be a heavy hitter."
"Legit lost 70% of the motivation to keep playing once I hit Great Cleave last night.

"Bow desperately needs a fix in terms of responsiveness. If you are aiming and use an abilities that is instant, specifically Rapid Shot, you will just stop aiming and be frozen in place for a few seconds, and nothing happens."
Surely the penetrating shot issue is unintentional? This is exactly why it was a good idea to have a PTR though. Players can find big issues like this before a patch goes live.
PvP players need to understand that there’s nothing AGS can do to get PvE players into PvP sadly. We don’t care for it as I’m one of them. I appreciate the incentives and all of that they’re trying to do but what do we miss out on? Stress lol Do I miss out on a lot? Bet your ass. Will I ever get gang banged 10v1? Fuck no I won’t.
"Haha, me (lvl57) and my friend (lvl56) teamed up for this last night. (skysong's end)  I was confused when the named summoner I solo'd the night before was a demi-god now.  Then..we luckily ran into a group of 3 lvl 60s.  Clearing the bosses with the 5 of us was not an easy task and one respawned before the other was killed.

These are on par with dungeon bosses now and need proper tank/healer 5 mans."
What if I told you that it's my favorite game AND I still think it's shit (in its current state)?
"You are wrong, patch 1.04 had a fix that didn't break anything else, that fix was  :

Lmao this dude thinks he can farm 1300 lifebloom flowers
"Regardless of incentive, I think early game a lot of people are grinding quests/town projects for XP to get to get to max level and get good gear. The last thing I need to worry about after running for 20 minutes to a quest is getting 4v1ed and having to spawn back 20 minutes away from where I’m going.  I think a lot more people will flag PvP when more people reach max level.  Until then, there are multiple wars everyday to hold you over."
If you need something for #20: Targeted Healing is a nightmare in any way. This needs to be addressed.
"I used to have pvp on all the time, then as I leveled up with better gear I realized it was super expensive to repair my gear so I do t do it so much. Also it seems like everyone on my server is 60 by now and I’m only 35."

"I have stopped playing now for real. but Honestly it's only because of a fresh POE league. Which is only fun for about 1-2 weeks. So I'll be back on new world. Even though it's broken AF and I hate it. It's basically an abusive partner, I should move on but I believe it's going to get better."

"I love to random heal.

"Easy answer - rather than have the nodes being dynamic or a seperate layer or anything, just paint a dot or icon on the base image of the map itself. 

Fairly certain the mods think the nodes are being detected or dynamically updated, and that is what they are against. It would make no sense being against the idea of an arrow representing the player set on a static image, whether that static image is a cute catboy or a map with extra scribbles."
">It’s disheartening to see others cheat to obtain what you have worked so hard to achieve, while also hurting the economy in the process.

On my server great axe players get rolled by mage boys. OPR has been very range heavy since the resilience fix.
"Harvesting modes:

Madman > Pvp on, Harvest gear, great loot.

What mode will you go with? :D

Edit. Few tweaks from comments"
The fact that your hp was full the entire fight was insane. You sir deserve my upvote. Well played!
Streamers are the death of online gaming IMO.
It’s obvious by now they don’t know how to do it .
Wouldn’t a server merge be combining low pop servers? That would mean the servers being combined would be coming from similar economies. I don’t think your low pop server is going to be merged with a high pop server.

"After having a few annoying quests left in Reekwater I decided to leave for Mourningdale Hamlet for something new, a fresh new zone to quest in.

First mission required me to kill some Withered, their models were the exact same as all the other I've killed so far. I don't know why, but in that moment I felt like I really needed to take a break from the game, right there and then. It felt too much like the same quests I was doing the first 5 levels, I just couldn't go on."

Mine was mined. I double procced.
"when comparing exp required for 200, it goes from 1.8mil total experience to 6.8mil total experience, which is an increase at a ratio of roughly 3.7

Looking at weaponsmithing for example, orichalcum warhammer gives 3.2x the experience on the PTR that it gives now. But you need 3.7x total experience to get to 200.

Of course, with the changes to ingredients required for crafting potions, this may well become easier, but the experience ratios seem worse currently."
Lmao I never knew his HP was that high. That's insane
"When fishing, while you are trying to reel in a fish, it will splash on top of the water when it is struggling hard, and there is no splash when it is not struggling allowing it to be reeled in quicker. So try to have your line tension at minimum to get the most progress during these times."
"It cheeses me off that they can switch off the economy at a whim yet for servers that are genuinely struggling for players awaiting mergers etc they cannot adjust invasions (not disable, adjust)

Fortunately the bug was not occurring on our server (simply because barely anybody has the major stuff) however freezing the economy yet again has other issues.. never recovered from the first time"

"It's unfortunate that the person in charge of the social media account got it wrong, but possibly tens of thousands of players relied on this and are now stranded due to it. Amazon needs to change their plans and allow cross region transfers because of this. Otherwise they are going to lose a lot of players."

But just like this post, people cried and it got nerfed into the ground, its best abilities removed and that pause you get after using any ability, that was added on purpose. AGS couldn't balance a cheque book."
Glad you guys are finding something to complain about when they try to fix the game

"It’s mostly because dungeon crawl is both, not efficient for exp and not efficient for gear. Gear is so abundant in NW that doing a dungeon isn’t necessary.

WoW always had login delays during transfers to prevent these sorts of data validation errors from occurring.

All I see is a server about to die and become one faction lmao bye bye pvp
Or it's because the quest variety is lacking severely this whole game is literally built on fetch quests haha.
I believe a lot of this is due to just simply how hard it is to successfully attack right now. A lot of this is due to just the other faction getting there first but once your able to start winning wars offensively things will change

"They just need to fix stuff. The problem is, in a month if a lot of things aren't fixed, people will start falling off.

If it wasn't for the fact that no other games really interest me or a lot of my company, we are here long term. But even I find myself feeling a bit cheated with so many issues from economy to end game not working.

Right now only 2/6 end game activities work."
"MMOs have this pattern. Or rather, gamers have this pattern with MMOs. When someone doesn't like one, they talk about it like it's the worst thing in existence instead of just accepting that they don't like it.

Turn your pvp on and fight for brightwood!
"41 and I barely play anymore. The worst thing is not only it's a stupidly tedious grind to level up, but it get worse at 60.

And that's in a game where most of the numbers don't work. Most gear perks don't work, lot of passive don't work, some passive breaks combat, gear drop are bugged, random perk on gear are awful even they work, etc..."
"My only concern at this point is how quickly they can remedy existing issues, fix the Econ, AND come out with a big splash content expansion to reel people back in. My biggest fear is the community dying due to lack of end game content and broken systems. Amazing foundation, I’ve certainly already gotten my $40 worth and much more."
I got gang-banged by 4 undead pirates that managed to knock me into a corner. They had me half way up the wall with knockback and I could not even touch them.

Not a huge deal but I dodged a fire blazing swordsman that literally one shots me with his dash or jump attack, medium gear 545gs, to get 15 motes from 3 chests lol.

What the actual fuck are these people doing?"
I was about to switch to an intelligence build because I was really looking forward to doing IG and FS but now I absolutely do not want to touch them. They will be last on the list if these changes make it into the actual game

"Ehhh 2nd response is presented like they intentionally changed hitboxes of Fire statt's pillar and ice storm and they will eventually sort out how they want the hitbox to be defined and balance it out definetevely.

"Unfortunately, I think it will still mostly tickle vs heavy armor. 

Did a test a few days ago without resilient on heavy armor, and it still took 10+ head shots with a musket to kill my buddy in a duel. 

It is a good start, dont get me wrong, but I think dex weapons still need a tweak. Maybe add armor pen? Idk."

"Most people are solo and endgame is tough and tedious for solo players. I am in a med pop server and we don't have anyone looking for dungeons. People are doing dungeons, but only with their guildies or friends. Outpost rush was the easiest way to get coins and gear but AGS thought it was a bad idea how dare you could get gears for playing solo.

I’m a 560 full str hatchet and great axe. I was struggling to kill lvl 35 gold elites in cutlass keys solo yesterday. Their health is just insane and they do non negligible damage.
"Went to kill the elite who drops the jewelcrafting shirt…. It’s now a 4 bar gold. No one is going to spend the time to get a group together to farm something that might not even drop the shirt on the first kill after all the effort to get there and get a group.

I’m a solo player, now I can’t do shit.

As a solo player in a low pop server this game just died for me with this patch."
My server turned into a game of Risen. Where you can solo farm everything. We are like 80 in server.
"I'm on the US East Coast servers and the number of bots there is just insane, if the economy is ""player driven"" then I don't know how it's ever going to function.  I walked out of Windsward to see five bots farming the wolves, another few bots harvesting the trees and rocks and about ten doing a loop and harvesting all the plants and stuff...they're clearing the place like locusts.  Are the EU servers the same?  We're thinking of moving over...when they fix the auction house."
"Im a musket rapier and there is this one mage in OPR in my server that 2 hits me everytime. You cant get near him as Ice gaunt fucks my rapier up. I think he itemized just to reduce thrust damage as for some reason my damage to him is not so big compared to another player i hit with light armor which i just tear up. I know hes light because he rolls. But other than that, you just cant solo a heavy armor at all. And cant outrun them. Then they just teabag you like they the best player out there."
"Game's been out for a few days and you're comparing it to WoW. You can't judge an MMO that quickly, you're just in the honeymoon phase of a brand new game."
"sounds like my server. last night we had our servers top PvP company declare war on the last green, and the last yellow had also declared war on another of our big PvP companies. If they both lose that's it. whole map purp."
My server was close to looking like this but my faction did the smart thing and threw some wars so the other people wouldnt quit
Downvoted by bots lul
Why don’t they want to talk to us? They need a new CM or something. They never even posted the patch notes for 1.02 on their OFFICIAL discord… it’s weird.
The tuning orbs are the dumbest PvE system I have ever seen. That steep cost of entry is absolutely too high. I guess they have to see the dungeon run statistics be very low to consider a change
Dumb question… I keep hearing that phrase. “Watermark farm”. What is it?
"Great info from the guy but I have a question.  
How is it possible to speak so freely about all of this? There is no NDA in AGS?"
"100% agree on everything. This needs to be fixed ASAP, especially as wars are the most appealing content for a lot of players. 
Fun end game content (wars) are gated behind a few heroes that are willing to play the discord/excel simulator as you said on the thread."
It’s only there because there’s literally nothing else to do. It’s an artificial timesink.
Buh bye doopers!  Let this be a warning to anyone who doops from thence forward.

"I feel completely useless as a tank outside of the expedition content, and I don't even feel particularly compelled to do one at 60. Or really anything. We get stomped during OPR. Useless in a war. Our taunts aren't powerful enough to redirect mobs during an invasion. ""Oh look I'm slow as hell and have 14k hp, allowing me to survive for 20 seconds while I get stun locked or magically interrupted."" :/"
Completely depends on what you expect out of it. If you want a visually and audio stunning mmo to play and don’t care about a lack of endgame and are more casual it’ll likely be the best mmo for you. If your a heavy grinder playing to endgame in mmos there’s probably better options.
"A lot of replies here are missing the problem. This isnt ""Great Axe: The Game"". You shouldnt have to use one or two specific weapons to clear out an area 15-20 levels lower than you. Its absurd.

And its not only in end game areas, since when is Eridanus in Restless Shores an end game area? I shouldnt have to min/max to take down lvl 46 mage enemies who have MORE HP than the boss they spawn next to.

Its been badly thought through, poorly implemented and the silence on it from AGS is deafening."
I’m leading a company on Yggdrasil also (Vinland) and they did the same exact thing to us last week after 6 hours of pushing influence. We reported them and made a forum post and it appears no action has been taken. Lots of lost moral and people not wanting to bother with pushing territory anymore

This happened to us today and we lost our territory for it. Not only does this feel terrible knowing that they got away with it and prob face no repercussions is even worse

"Cool idea, but I imagine the implementation would not be easy.

An immediate alternative is to coordinate with another faction to take over. You would then need to organize your faction not to help the current company's defense. Then, you would organize your own faction to retake the area, but under new company management."

I want some of the quests changed. like if you want me to hunt five animals but only three spawn into the ambiguous area you need me to kill them then I'm waiting the full spawn timer. Even though the same animal is spawning just outside the area and won't count if you hunt it.

There's a 10 person limit per company when defending against an invasion?  But that limit is bypassed if there are no other sign ups so they kicked everyone who wasnt in their company?

"Yes and no, I've played a lot of MMOs at launch and the population usually stabilizes 3-4 months in with occasional spikes during big updates and events. Very rarely the population recovers after that drop, but it has happened."
No one ever crafts Laz/Gen orbs and any time someone doing the quest for each gets one people pounce on the opportunity to get a run in for free essentially. These are still way too expensive timewise to make which is really disappointing because expeditions are basically the only pve content in this game I genuinely enjoy and feel challenged by

It’s an absolute nightmare and this makes the life of a faction lead incredible annoying and time consuming. This is just one part of it that needs major work such as guild management tools and a raid system so we can see our parties. For a game so focused around large scale pvp it’s incredible lacking
Op doesn’t understand that the actual issue is OPR buffs. T3 command tent battle bread alone is a 35% damage bonus and mitigation buff.  Most players dont even know about the t3 command tent buffs. Show me this happening in world pvp or wars

Great setup but you still have a space to change one of the gear for something heavier and got additional dmg absorb right?

"Property tax should be decreased in general or at least paid biweekly/monthly and not every 5 days, it's a game and we shouldn't be overwhelmed with paying rent, especially that it became a griefing tool with companies setting it to 20% every time they take over enemy territory, just to fuck with you.

Everybody is complaining about healer being invincible until their healer died during expedition or group PVE and suddenly it's the healer's fault.
"Well no, healers shouldn't live through 13 people...or 10...or 5 or hell 3 for that matter (assuming the 3 or 5 aren't simply awful, miss a lot, and are doing nothing but LMBs and whiffing a lot).

"Fun fact, this picture is very accurate, but what you don't see, is that those 2 people sitting on the belly of exploit users."
Other people have said it but New World almost seems like a game made by an algorithm.
"No leave them in. Just rework them a bit. Less hp, no resetting hp, longer timer on the pull."
"Well that's odd because in beta I got banned and one time they wouldn't do shit as after the auto ban they check it, the second ban they overturned due to the auto ban being wrong. So they've changed it since beta or they're lying."
Meanwhile the people who waited a day for the new servers: just playing whenever they want
"The fact that only New World is the recent game that is making these ""faulty"" cards brick is what makes people say its the cause of the problems, it just looks like a bad game design, if it would happen to other new games people could say it is 100% a GPU problem, but when there is only 1 game that is triggering the problem, you know its a problem with the game."

It's that simple huh?
"If its the exploit where the opposing team purposefully spams as many AoE abilities as possible and have tank hold block on the point while the server freezes due to the aoe spell, then yes -- they should have been reported.


More and more people trying to win wars are  doing that bull to basically make their tank un-attackable while the server shits itself from the aoe spell spam so their tanks can cap without being pushed off or taking damage.

Its 100% an exploit and done intentionally."

"Would be nice if we could in some way have two slots to save preset. You could have one for your preferred damage setup/solo play and one for your preferred group role.

Could give it a 30min cooldown between swapping preset or something."
We should have seen this coming during beta. My dumbass actually hoped it will be better. But everyday there is new exploit and they do nothing to players that abuse them. People are getting away with them and if you didn't do it you will fall behind.
"The yellow faction on my server has been duping voidbent gear,  and the Mats to make it,  they have two full companies decked out in gear atm"
Yea OR is an exploited state rn hopefully more people are able to see the actual issues in big group pvp rn
"you made an excellent video with adjorjan and this is also an excellent video. you speak very clearly and without ums or pauses.

i appreciate this material since solo progression options are really scarce and desperate once reaching 60. 

on your google sheet you indicated on line 565 a helmet drop of 593, which is in line with the soft cap of 591 being fixed.



So your watermark is 593, not 590"
Lock your FPS in the settings to 60 and reduce the amount of players name tags you can see through settings as well
"MMOs have died by adding too many servers at launch which then thin out as the initial playerbase leave resulting in dead servers and unplayable content. The current volume of servers is designed for the launch population which is 4x bigger than what we have now. In my server expensive mats don't sell, outpost rush doesn't happen and it's difficult to find groups. Global is quiet and people constantly complain that it's dead. So merges ASAP are important for the survival of the game."
"I'm not hating the WM system (dungeon orbs aside, which they'll fix) as much as i miss proper solo alternatives. Despite the game being unmistakeably group orientated, and I actually like that + I don't dislike zerg-like mechanics/design (Silver Wastes anyone?), i'd like to be able to do stuff on my own. Doesn't even have to be super effective, just doable within reason and i'd be super fine. I'm personally losing my motivation FAST."
"there is a company in my server that did the same.  still running strong , temp bans. and that s it."
Glad to hear it. It’s a step in the right direction.  Combat can be sluggish at times and it feels like you run into pauses too often. You are stuck waiting before you can move.  This makes positioning and reactions painfully slow.  Hopefully this gets addressed
"meanwhile 2 heavy hits against a shield and it knocks down stam to 0, making a tank completely useless for like 5-7 seconds"
Watch any video with Ion Hazzikostas from the last 5 years. He detests the people who play his game. That put me off immensely from returning to WoW.
"sure.. dupe all the gold you want, dupe 500k gold and dupe thousands of stacks of void ore and get banned for 24 hours, make a miniboss respawn a few times.. thats a 3 day ban for you dickhead"
"This is why I stayed on the highest pop server. Just take that opportunity to farm up, free void ore. Free motes, free starmetal, free everything. Hell if I were you I’d be farming entropy once/week for free because knowing AGS they will merge servers well before fixing professions and if you get a couple sets of weaponsmith pants you’ll make an absolute fortune on high pop server."
"I wouldn't mind if OPR gave good watermark, or if they made it to the same level as elite chest. Activities that people do for fun at level 60 should grant watermark so you have some sort of linear progression while having fun. Right now the watermark grind is heavy on elite runs which isn't fun in my opinion. Dungeons and war and pvp should grant more watermark compared to other means. Just my thoughts."
Thx man ! I thought I m the only one hating bears 😑
Happy New Year!
How are you able to get that many mats to roll?
"And we dont even get some infos... im the only one left from our 9 man group, who still plays atleast some Outrush"
"This is such a bullshit answer. ""We took a course of action with no idea how to implement that we can work out on Monday. All the Europeans should be eating Turkey with their families any way.""

I feel like they really treat the lack of a subscription with such disrespect. We paid for this and you broke it. You have to fix it in a timely manner it doesn't matter if we pay up front or monthly."
Yeah i crafted the Hammer for some1 in my company - we both didnt see it was bind on pickup. So i had to take it for myself and give him the mats...
Granted. You now have 1000 storage weight globally
"Never pick the xp cards with the territory standing, they're useful while leveling but at lvl 60 you'll want any extra storage or reducing costs will be much better over time"
We crashed on the island and began duping.

Maybe I will get some chores done today after all."
"Every so often when I alt tab, the game crashes due to a cheat violation detected on LEDKeeper2.exe. Do you want to know what LEDKeeper2.exe is? It's MSI's software for controlling LED lighting on motherboards and DRAM slots.

">Those items sell like hot cakes because nobody knows that you're supposed to go back and build items for other players. Nobody leveling at Tier 2 is going to find the quality of the items i build them.

Unfortunately for many of the largest European servers this isn't true because our servers still have locks on them preventing new characters being made by new accounts. There's no new players joining so there's no economy to sell to low level players."
I just want open world pvp back like it was week one of release. I can go hours playing and not see another flagged person lol
"Is there a luck requirement for void ore? I've been trying to farm it like crazy and have plenty of cinnabar/tolvium but I feel like it doesn't exist. I have ~4.5-4.6% mining luck on all armor, 3 minor trophies, 1700 luck food, 9% amulet and 8% pick... This is pretty much the best that's available on my server right now."
luckily im too dumb to use any gold exploits.
"Great Axe users get to rip a hole in reality.  Musket users get three different ways of loading extra powder for the next shot.  Setting the effectiveness of the skills aside, some imagination in deciding the skills would have been appreciated.

Also, shooter stance should be a feature of the weapon (i.e. faster reloading while prone).  They can fill in the skill gap with something actually interesting."
this is the dumbest problem to have holy shit lmao
"I love how in the first 2 weeks of the game when I always had pvp flag on, whenever I would run into a gaxe/hatchet heavy armor guy who absolutely ganked me in my light armor with rapier and fire always shit talked me coz i did literally 0 damage to them, acting like they're some big shot. being ahead of the curve sure is fun"
"Good vibes from this group of adventurers on reddit.

"I love firing off a beacon, missing, and then following them until it comes back off CD to miss again....

I need to get better at aiming my heals :("
As a rapier player I was so sad when I got this weapon. Most of the quest stuff I’ve blown up idk if that was the smart thing to do because I saw somewhere they can keep being upgraded but Idk how true that is. Most of the quest items kinda blow. This rapier broke my heart because I’ve played the game as a light armor rapier character and it just isn’t working for me at level 57. I’ve recently went med armor and I’m thinking of going to another weapon/play style.
Depends if you compare it to Wildstar or succesful mmo's.
I think dev teams should play wayyyyyyy more pvp....

"so, they did maintenance earlier mainly for 2 things, reimbursment of coins and giving back the gear, then they reverted the gear and the other thing as always was pushed broken and fucked up the game even more?"
I'm on a break from it right now. I hope it gets better. Maybe in a year I'll pick it back up and give it another try.
"Yeah i've got to the point where i'm out of coin, ammo for my bow, potions, food etc. I am on a small server and if i find anyone to sell these, they are for a rip off price. 

I'm out of azoth and OPR no longer happens, even at peak time.

I'm thinking about New World less & less sadly, i probably won't even notice if or when the trade post is fixed as i'll have found something else."
"1 hour Chest runs in Shattered are pretty good now. Fetidfang cave, Odium, 3 big supply stockpiles in Ambusti if you want, then Pullus, Lapsus and the 4 by angry earth.

I farmed all my mats. 100-150 silk/layered gloves; 150-200 infused silk/infused leather gloves
How far zoomed out are you? I see clips and they look much more zoomed out than I can get. Even with fov.
They don't care about bots. On my server they're exploiting some speed buff (either that or just straight up speed hacking) and running around mining nodes. I even posted it on the forums yesterday but not a single dev seems to care.

"The real reason is to prevent infinite hoarding. If they decide to change the rarity of a particular item, it will *eventually* take effect instead of needing to wait until people burn through literal years of old stockpiles.

Even if they merged all the servers in my world set we will still be at 35%.  I am just gathering and leveling skill sets like a MF. Did a whole run of Weavers fen this morning at 1am. I love it. I will be shitting arcana for days.
"i love how they're taking back a lot of their insane requirements and removing a lot of their caps/limits, the dumbest part is that there are people who defend this type of gameplay. hopefully they'll be massively increasing storage space in the near future."
I think the bigger issue here is heavy armor. At the moment there is no downside to it. The damage is baseline and the tankiness is so good. They still are able to access all the mobility and utility abilities that anyone else can. The issue is being tanky is the best way to do it right now for PvP. I’m a hatchet user but I run Med Load and people in heavy do just as much damage as I do. There is no downside.
"We were talking about the possibility of this in discord last night. Some guy came out of nowhere selling majors for 12k in global and said he had a bunch. When a few of us pressed in DM he said he had just transferred from a server where they are really cheap and loaded up before moving over.

It’s really hard to see how that could happen without rampant duping, so that’s the conclusion we came to."
"I actually miss the heal chains on EQ raids, ten second cast time for a massive heal on the tank, with a half dozen clerics working together, we could kill anything."

"I mean Amazon has already messed up the economy 3 different times, not enough materials = price inflation, then they threw us a bone and gave us all the materials = market crash, then the fortunate people that were online during the 2 hours before the patch that changed materials back to base rate made bank.

"Yeah on my server everyone runs heavy/life staff, Heavy/mace all full con and fire staff. I rarely see leather/cloth to do 6K damage. I'm typically hitting for 500-1600.

Some games bow feels great and majority it feels like a nightmare in larger scale pvp.

Edit: Everyone on my server is also constantly spamming their dodge and crouch."
Seems a little odd that they would have ever had family share as an option for this game in the first place.

"I don't think this is a bad idea, but they might want to fix the whole mass report ban situation that people are complaining about first.

Otherwise, you'll just see companies standing in the area waiting for other faction people to come on and they'll get mass reports so the faction or company can keep ahold of the area and resources."
" Nothing. I like all those things.

I would love to have the specs stick to the weapon.
Not sure if anyone’s said it but you get 2 keys for Lazarus and one for genesis by just doing the side quests In the high level zones you can get them but best to save the keys for high level watermark for chances at the legendaries :)
This. It's the only thing holding me back from being flagged %100 of the time.
"The biggest problem for me with the musket is that everyone is wearing heavy armor in PVP. I can also see why it is a bit underbalanced. If a group learned to coordinate their shots, it could be a pretty devastating weapon at invasions."
I’d never pay for some fucker to run me through a dungeon anyway. Much rather do the content with guildies.
"I don't really believe this, or at least there's more going on than they're leading on. The behaviour we saw and are seeing in game don't seem to line up with what this post says.

""Oopsie woopsie we had widdle bugsie"" does not explain why the client was able to determine if it received damage, if it should delete gold, if it should be affected by gravity, etc.

A lot of the issues we are seeing all make sense if you look at it from the perspective of a client-side authority."
Parkour!
You are amazing! If I had an award to give I'd give it to you! Thank you so much for this!

This is incredible! Congrats from a fellow engineer. I sold a 585 God Roll Axe for 15k. I’m sure you can get 30k to 40k depending on your server’s economy. Do not cheap sell this thing if you don’t plan on using it yourself!

"Oh no…. Musket, Spear…."
man... these guys are like missing every second hit.. holy shit lol
if you nerf healing there will be no healers.. you whine where there is not many.. wait to see what happens when there is NONE. It is a sacrifice to play as a healer for your friends to stay alive and do content.
This is more Egyptian / Babylonian style. Quite nice as this is rarely in games.

"It's neat, but it does raise the minimum level a bit so it's not all upside (at least for jewelcrafting). It is pretty funny that people undercutting me have +10 stats on T3 rings since they just started where as mine are +14-15 with the same mats, and I've gotten minimum gearscore food/gear to do the same to T4 as well."
"Main reason I still don't have a house, they actually want me to play the game for rent money. Bitch I don't even like rent IRL. No one does, that shit cracks me up"

"I'm only level 41 but feel like all I can do are faction or town missions as the main story quests all go through elite territory or where, as in my current mission, the mobs are 7 levels higher.

"If a company exploits as obviously as this, it shows how confident they are AGS will do nothing to stop them.

Honestly, perma bans for the officers and temp bans for the rest seems the only reasonable response."
 I love pvp but I also love having my pvp have mechanics that doesn't involve just killing. You can suck at pvp and still contribute by getting those brutes. Not only that but the other team can do it too. Kind of like baron.
You’re not forced to do it man you just want that juicy bonus. That bonus is tied to a risk. You take the risk and the reward or neither. There’s nothing preventing you from gathering without flagging.
"I think the stagger overall needs to be revamped. 1v1 mob or player is fine but once you get multiples is just annoying as hell especially in PvP. No idea what they could do to make it better though, I didnt want to lose the Dark Souls combat vybe."

"The combat is so not fluid and responsive when it comes to this at all, especially if you're swapping to immediately cast an ability. Combat already feels like shit sometimes because it was built around PvP, so you can't animation cancel out of your attacks with a roll or to bring your shield up, just so it lets you get ""punished"" sort of speak"

"In my server it's very much 50/50 turf wise between my faction the Maruaders and the Syndicate. Covenant has only one region. Right now we are getting invaded my Syndicate, so hopefully we will rally together to push them back. Overall the Maruaders are very unfied under one multi company and we're intent on beat them back. Syndicate is starting to have infighting as well, so hopefully they will be clumsy in them warring."

Unpopular opinion: I hate unpopular opinion posts
"Part of it is because you don’t care about story and world building. The main reason I stopped playing this game was because doing town board quests over and over was boring and the quests and world in this game feel bland and unfinished.

Our entire guild/friend group decided to transfer to another server where some others friends were playing. I went to bed and decided to do it the next day after work. Now I'm stuck by myself in Yaxche.. these 2 days have really been a no bones days :(

If 26% harder isn't significantly harder then sure this post is reasonable.
those trade and weapon quests sound dope! cant wait.
"I hope those weapon mastery quests they talk about serve as a means for players to raise the watermark for that weapon - right now the current watermark system is extremely frustrating, since it is on a per-weapon basis and makes it a complete crapshoot as to whether or not you'll actually raise your GS on your primary weapons."
What's the point of jumping?
"You maxed your trade skills, so whenever anyone sees you using those maxed trade skills they probably also think you exploited to get it  . ."
"Can't wait for v2.0 of this post when the new patch comes out, with great axe \_buffs\_"
"> And I feel that. But coming here to complain after playing 500+ hours in 2 months is, in my opinion, insane.

What is insane about that? Those are people that went hard on the game. Liked it even through all the shit that plagued it since release. Gave AGS the benefit of the doubt with it being release issues that can be expected and hoped it would get better. Then AGS completely butchered it with 1.1."
The problem is that the professions generate little value early on so they only become worth it at max level + armor + food + trophy. This creates a play environment that makes the player grind a huge sinkhole of mats before they can start getting value out of their profession. The fix is to find ways to create value for the player in the journey to max profession. The path to 200 should be fun and rewarding.
I’m with you.  I want accountability from the higher up devs
Papa Bear: The Raid
"this is what people think, but ags has fucked all their players evenly with 1.1.

my hwm is 600 on armor and almost all the weapons. i spammed lazarus about 20 times since 1.1, got a bunch of named weapon drops in the weapons where my hwm was 600, none of them dropped higher than 587.

edit: forgot to add, i got **zero** pieces of 600 gear.

was running full luck set which sits around 35%.

why should anybody even bother playing this dogshit game?"
"Or, you can just sell 1/4 of those resources required on the market and just buy the things you wanted to craft at 200."

"This is exactly what so many of us Alpha1 testers were saying about the direction changes the game made from Alpha 1 to Alpha 2.

"Yea, it is not the fault of new world that these cards are failing, but new worlds is interacting with the cards in a way that has aparently not been done by another game thus exposing this flaw.  

This is why some people are recommending that people with 30xx cards wait to play it or at least underclock their cards."
I'd pay an extra $5 per month for a dedicated in-game bot police.
"Let's not forget ""Seeing when an ally of the same faction has PvP on"""
Yeah they really fail at giving incentives to be on the weaker side. There are going to have to figure something out or the pvp is going to suffer
"Im excited for new content in a few months or so. Theres no monthly fee, so if the game is stale for a bit and cycles in playerbase before new content, im okay with that.  
With that in mind, i hoenstly cant think of any western MMO that had loads of content on release. I was around for Vanilla WoW! haha This will be a conversation worth having in 3 months time when its crucial for the Devs to pump something out.   
So far, ive gotten my $50 worth, no matter what happens"
What if instead of pve resource (e.g. high nodes for pve crafting) it would give a pvp resouce (e.g. pvp oriented gear)? It’s hard to navigate the line but i do believe all types of players needed to be considered

"Yeah that is right! I haven't farmed those yet but I was farming the lower level ones for 6 hours and got enough for 3 orbs. Also, you only get shards from the bigger corruption portals. Idk if the higher level ones are different, but the 25, 35, and 45 are all like that. 

They need to increase the drop rate by 3 or 4 times for me to even care about it. I can't believe FLG groups dont demand a fee to join them."
What about 500gs faction gear being nearly as good if not better than voidbent. :>
What armor is that?
The first syndicate company that took a territory on my server did this but they jacked all the tax rates to max before they quit.

iron arrows and bullets can some times be handy in an emergency but it would be really nice to break them down into iron ingots. especially since iron ingots are so fucking required for basically all crafting."

In one of my most recent outpost rush matches I got an epic spear named weedkiller. I only have spear watermark at around 530 but it was 600. Got me really hyped to play more.

"> AGS unbanning someone who has done this is the problem.

The 24-hour auto-ban is designed to mitigate damage and isn't a final decision by AGS (they don't even refer to it as a 'ban'—they call it an 'action'). A permanent ban can take a week or more for individual cases like this.

The user probably wasn't 'unbanned' by AGS as a result of their petition (which can also take a week or so to be processed), but rather simply waited out the timer."
So much of emotions in 10 minutes. And 20k of weight
Easier to farm mays though. Crush those trade skills.
"Engineering. It has so many QoL items making it seem like a good investment of resources as you level it. New tools, repair kits, ammo, etc are all things that can be used as you make them. Plus, it all sells for a decent amount as you level."
Congratulations 🥳
Lol the game is clearly missing a shit ton of features that should be standard in this type of game. It is fun but criticism is well deserved.
"There seems to be one common argument against this, and it's one with an easy fix. Let us see our inventory while moving but have to be stopped to use consumes or switch gear. I can't be the only one that hits it while autorunning just to go through what I have on me after a long-time out in the field only to be reminded I can't do it."

The solution is more along the lines of penalizing group v single rather than incentivising flagging.
"Big agree for DAoC siege mechanics, taking a flag instead of killing the lord or commander seems like a silly choice. More reason for upgraded areas as it makes the lord stronger also"

"any client side exploit can be keybound. Somone good at computer can make the ""."" key an invulnerability key."
100% true. We have a faction in our server that uses every new exploit to get their wins over wars. And they put spy/dummy accounts to disable us from chatting strategy/plan changes on faction chat. Not to mention a streamer promoting toxicity & harassment on camera. Literally 0 actions or banned against this shit.
oh no so outpost rush is not really a good way to increase watemark? i was hoping it was :(
"I would also like to point out that healing doesn't do much to actually encourage actually healing especially in pve as you get no experience from it. 

This practically forces healers to spend some time infliciting damage so that they can actually level their skills."
"Would be nice if they also changed mat progression, so that u dont need to permanently farm iron and hemp to get a T5 mat.. I mean, this change makes the T5 mats more relevant, but they are still bottlenecked by the availability of T1 which doesn't really make sense (which in turn limits the availability of T1 for fresh leveling)"
Quit.
"I hope they can making luck visible to us (see the exact number of luck we have), so that we can see if a certain item is working or not(for example, mining luck amulet vs no amulet). Psychology said that people will experience less anxiety if they can know something for certain, the exact amount of luck, in this case."
Make it happen... Long term it would be better. Many who have quit would come back if they see Hard stance against cheating
"One faction servers are coming. This buff should've been applied to minority factions. Not only does the majority faction get the town perks and travel perks, but they are also going to own the nodes while flagged due to sheer population advantage. This isn't going to play out like they intend at all and is only further incentivizing people playing the dominant faction."
We lost our whole city due to the last patch. Glad they fixed the wars so they could absolutely fuck them up this patch.  Test this fucking shit.  How hard is it!?!?!
This where this game fucking shines for me tho. The pvp is awsome to watch and to be part of

"Just a piece of friendly advice; conventional wisdom is to never roll a skill perk on a weapon. Skill perks can be applied to, or rolled on weapons AND armor alike while many of the strongest perks available roll exclusively on weapons.

The idea is to get strong weapon perks like Keen, Refreshing Move, Viscous and several others on your weapons while rolling any skill perks you need on your armor.

With that said the void gauntlet perks not rolling is a problem that needs addressing."
"I haven't had gold but I have had minus XP, it legit pops up and highlights the bar and gives the same text but says -25xp. Also had people in my friends list see me as a different faction and different level, I wouldn't be surprised if somehow it's pulling somebody else data"

"After hitting 60 I have been doing nothing but losing gold, every step I do I just lose gold.

You want to explore areas well if you die lose gold on repairs.

You want a house? lose gold on tax.

You want to craft and sell items? lose gold on crafting then hold up the items you crafted cost more to list than to sell so you lose gold anyway.

They really need to start giving more ways to get gold or lower all those gold consuming systems to 20% of what it currently is."
Welcome to MMOs. Where healers are overlooked and tanks are bitched at.
"That's a very good question. My first thought was ""I make all my gold from the auction house"". But obviously that's just taking gold from other players. Questing is the only real good source of gold. It's like a giant ponzi scheme that is about to come to a halt when all the quests dry up."
"Out of curiosity, do you have any other extra damage percent? It might be that all forms of extra damage are being added then multiplied to your base damage as one sum. For example. Say you deal 1000 damage. You might expect to see 1200 damage. But what if the 1000 damage was after a 20% increase to damage. So the base damage would have been 833.33. If increased damage is additive then you would get 833.33(1.4) = 1166 which is lower than you expected."

"Yeah this game is a time sink, but just because it is one does not mean you are forced to grind it out immediately. Do things in stride and have fun. I personally like mindlessly gathering and building up crafting."
"
Same. Stopped playing more then 30 minutes tops. Fuck this. Not going to try and catch up at all anymore."
Honestly well-deserved at this point.
"Agree. For a game that was allegedly planned as pure PvP, it's atrocious to actually play PvP."
Also leave a steam review or change your current one!
"except the Well Guardian.

But ya, I came back to help my friends with that poppa bear quest.  That boy was impossibly thick for any group of 5.  Luckily they all had a level 60 friend.  I think that’s the intent."
"One off $40 sure - there is plenty in there for 100 hours just messing about.

Are there issues, sure. For your first 100 hours or so I doubt you will be affected to the extent that it will impact your overall gameplay."
"Serious contributing factor as to why I quit. Was so hyped to level with friends. For a game that shamelessly rips off features from countless other MMOs..

*Why the fuck won't AGS rip off Party-Sync from Warcraft??*

20+ people in my IRL friend group started this game together, none of us have *ever done a world quest together*

Needless to say - no one is playing anymore."
I’ve been thinking about switching servers for real. My current server has like 300 people at peak. It used to be about 900 so it was alright. Now it’s dead like 90% of the time and I’m on the lowest faction. There about about 60 of my faction out of like maybe 300 people.
"I have been playing mmo for a long time with all the bugs and problems, I can say the game is amazing and if they develop it right, it might be one of the best mmo. The only big disappointment you may face is the unbalanced classes so you might play some role you don't like just because it is OP. and if you are a pvp fan you might not like the pvp system that allows you to attack only ppl on pvp mode. In addition to the poor stats about the character."

"Put honey and water in your consumable slots, you can stack them to 10K and they have no weight there. Used for cooking and potion making."

What's worse is my gun not reloading and I can't shoot.
I use the same perks and abilties very good combo bow plus hatchet.
"Yup, first war last night...500 people signed up for it. They can only take 50. I realized right then this wasn't going to work for most people."

"Always on fire me as well

There's so many people T bagging though. Then again. With how popular the game is. It's expected"
"This seems like a big missed opportunity just in general. You walk into a town and there's all these buildings, but you can only walk into like two because they're all instanced player houses. Then you walk into those two buildings and there are all sorts of objects all over the place, but none of it at all is interactive save for an occasional book."
Can we also give an honorable mention to those corrupted guys who clearly think they're a turkey by the sound they make?
"Soo... that's why people randomly send stuff my way when im peacefully fishing. NOT EVERYONE IS A BOT OK, SOME JUST TRYING TO SMOKE THEIR SHISHA AND HAVE A CHILL TIME OK."
it's a bit weird that they have allowed overwolf to work for the game and they even provided Overwolf with an api for the player location. They even whitelisted Overwolf to interact with the game (Overwolf is injected into the game which requires read&write permissions). So saying they don't allow it is super conflicting and they should of just resolved it with the Overwolf team.
"He's currently streaming and trying to play it off as if it is something that literally everyone does. According to him, even people like Shroud and such cause it."
Happening on yulbrada too. Thai companies doing it
"For me the top MMOs all excel in different areas. While sharing many of the same elements each one stands out among the others.

EvE is economy
WoW is raids
FFXIV is story
BDO is character building
GW2 is pvp
Old Republic is environment and universe

New World really doesn’t stand out in any aspects for me. Everything is just average, it has all the elements but doesn’t really excel anywhere."

To say this is the best MMO doesn’t even make sense.

A level 6 wolf will aggro my level 52 character but be perfectly cool clipping into and ignoring level 1 turkeys, sheep, and goats."

"Same thing happened in FFXIV and ESO when they launched.  Gold dupe.

Both games are fine these days.  🤷‍♂️"
"aren't dex builds hugely reliant on crits though? resilient will still be popular and it will reduce damage from backstabs, headshots and normal crits, which with 300 dex are very common

strength builds rarely crit anyways and are the big winners of this patch"
Op is full of it
"First of all, upgrade your cpu fan, this game forced me to go from stock cooler to a hyper 212 evo, now my temp wont push 70. Also dusting out your pc will be huge."
"Might be time for a cooler upgrade.

Also, look in the mother board settings and make sure you are not running some sort of overclock.  A lot of those profile over clocks use a higher voltage than needed creating more heat."
I should've just asked for my friend via family share instead of spending 30$ F.
still deals no damage lol
If your are level 60 you have many options to make money to buy t1 mats. Farming them is a waste of time
">Low level wolves , pigs and zombies

you forgot to include sheep.

while leveling, I was on a cliff, looking for some iron, when a sheep appeared of nowhere, rammed me and made me fall down the cliff. fortunately, falling doesn't kill you."
Meanwhile I haven't even seen ori ore for days because it's getting camped so hard haha. GZ on the drops!

My company does elite runs nightly but I still can’t bring myself to play. Earlier today I came across a small time streamer on my server being really excited about the end game; just couldn’t help keep picturing him as the “This is Fine” Dog.
have they fixed flawed gems doing more damage than higher tier gems?
Have you done anything out of the ordinary while crafting? Or same as usual ?
"there is gold here, it's just covered in exploits and bugs which need to be fixec"
Have my upvote you lonely friend.
"80 rolls is actually not very many at all. Even at 595-600, its like 13 legos... The chance to get 3 perfect, or even good perks and pure stat is astronomically low."
"I'm uneducated, what does BIS mean? I've seen it float around in different communities from new world to genshin impact."
Because the game is poorly implemented from the ground up.
I still don’t struggle against GA/WH as a mage. I’ve run IG/FS - FS/Rapier - FS/ Void. You can I frame dodge slot of the hammer abilities as a medium armor.
"I do kinda wish that medium weight prevented the stationary staggers, and that heavy weight prevented all staggers"

They need to allow respec. The faction reputation is increasing tokens as well. Players clearly didn't have enough info to chose their cards correctly.
"Full voidbent, nothing to do other than occasionally watermark grind or haplessly gain half a level of engineering after making 200 ori muskets."
"It's a paradox. Longer queue times because of people doing this, and people doing this because of the queue times."
Have you tried tanking with sword/shield as offhand?
Fishing bots? In an MMO? Unprecedented!
It needs a better pve that isnt just go here kill x or go here find x
"The complete opposite is happening on my server. After a fast syndicate start maraudeur are conquering every territory one after another. 

We just can't defend against them, they are just dominating."

"Welp, RIP my characters when I move across the planet in a few months, was hoping I could hit up the transfer service  myself."
"The people who don’t want scaling are ironically gonna be majority leaving the game down the line when they complain there’s no one flagged for pvp. They aren’t looking for pvp, they’re looking for an ego boost to shit on lower levels and with scaling they wouldn’t be able to do that. This change is why I say the game was actually better before the delay."
"The last thing I need in my life is another mortgage payment, even a fake one.  Every 5 days?  That sucks for a casual, come-and-go player.

I obsess over housing in other games.  Here, I'm giving it a pass."
Also the fact that someone can run through a zone pulling all the mobs and they aggro them onto you.
"also, right now, holding territory means mostly a net loss, which is ridiculus"
GLORF! We'll miss you. Have fun on your adventures on your new server.
"I'm actually thinking of switching to the piss company, since at least their leaders make proper war squads and go full zerg mode as intended.

Instead of my current faction just running around like headless chickens able to cap 1 point and then get pushed back into camp for the rest of the match.."
Sounds about right. That is how the game is at the moment.
Why do you have a shield?
And people wonder why AGS didn't make a full-loot PvP game...

I always put “Nuff said”
Was wondering why my Hatchet throws were hitting 4k's...
My Governor is going around bragging about cheating and how he pulled the money out of our treasury after and hasn't gotten banned. Feels bad.
"No one is going to believe someone getting banned for “no reason”. You have to have done SOMETHING even if it seems like an unjustified ban. We’re you gambling in chat? Force a quick respawn on a mob? Did you handle void ore that might have been duped? There are things we can try to help you justify, but I cant believe that there’s not a single thing worth mentioning in this post besides “for no reason”."
"I've wasted my dynasty orb on a fake Healer. Level 60 but only 3 levels in healing staff. Max intelligence fire staff.

I joined another party, fake tank level 60 but only 6 levels in sns and don't know what are taunt skills and carnelian gems

I'm a dungeon crawler type of mmo player. I'm not coming back until they redo the Turing orb system."
Paf?
Don't forget the hover issue where you trigger a hover if you are browsing the hover menu of a player and hover a different player button which is underneath the menu you are browsing. That should be a really quick fix.
"I would rather have an option to ""move"" house to other town with the same tier spot, for example T4 house can only move to another T4 spot in another town with a small fee that is the TAX of the new zone.

Just like in real life, you need to move all your furniture to the new house, so all the furnitures will be deposited to the stash and you gotta bring all those furnitures to the new zone; either walking or pay azoth."
Good soup
Life Staff as primary and Hatchet as secondary
There are so many people with dupes accounts that went consequence free that will be rich beyond anyone else until the game crashes and burns.
"No matter what perma-banning someone for spam is way over the line Amazon.

Guess those guys never heard of mute as punishment. Keep it up and demand explanation at least.

I cant get over the lack of explanation when someone recieve a ban. Like if you punishing someone at least tell them what for.
 Its the same in real life so why its not working in games.

To sum it up. Spam is not a bannable offence anywhere. Mute is appropriate punish.
Keep the preasure on Amazon to get propper explanation."
"I’ve sunk 350 hrs into the game. Put it down while shit gets fixed. Will wait until:
- they fix the duping stuff
- they fix the piss poor game performance
- add more challenging end game than looping for chests in a train

I have high hopes for this game but I can’t be bothered to play this clunky ass version of it. I’m sure they are hard at work and once them bugs are ironed out I’ll be back to sink more hours in"
"Honestly, the solution to the problem AGS perceived was not to change the difficulty of the existing content and cut its loot - that gets us what people are rightfully upset about here.

Solution would have been to release a new tier of endgame area that amped up the difficulty, moved the GS cap 5-10 points at most. then you can have balls to the wall hard enemies for people to throw themselves at, and gamers would be thanking AGS."
"My server has 320 people online as of Saturday, 8PM. This exact time last week, it had 630 people online.

I think people are definitely taking your advice!"
"My review of NW has been negative for longer than most.

But despite that, I say, leave a fair review. If you believe it should be negative, then leave a negative one. But if you think it's positive overall and just want to protest... I dunno. I think consistently honest reviews from players leads to better development than review bombs that go away when they fix a thing or two but not make sweeping changes."
and on the other side it's me trying to solo papa bear at level 35
Should be afraid of the guy above the bear too.
"The sad thing is they could have additional modifiers on skills in the skill tree for balancing reasons.  


For exemple. Sword and board's defensive formation could read like ""While blocking, reduce damage taken for you and alllies by 30%"" Additionaly with 250 constitution or above, you gain grit while blocking""  


Same goes for any other weapons. Add something to skills with additional benefit if you get certain stat threshold"
"Anyone remember Warhammer Online?

That was a good mmo."
"Looks awesome man, thanks!"
"My company tried to wait it out on a barely 200-peak server where we owned Windsward and our faction was dominant, but we just couldn't do it. Think we would've all quit the game if there wasn't an option to transfer. We went last week to a higher pop server and the game's finally fun again."
"Literally no reason to force OPR to play on a single server only. Make it a global queue ffs.

Been waiting all day to get in in at 300 ppl now. Probly be cuz of this shit
"Bro exactly...I'm getting so much shit from my mates for the build I'm running. I haven't done any research. This game is so incredible that I just want to play and figure what works for me. I joined a random party and they were so impressed with my set up. Fuck haters mine that iron ore. Oh and also stun is broken af.  


If you don't want to hear how incredible this game is then don't talk to me grandma kek"
"I'm in a company of 5 friends and I'm going to be in a war tonight for a fellow faction. Maybe by the time I log in to ight I might be replaced but I'm certain of you try to communicate with the owner of the company at war they might be able to find spots for you. 
I just signed up and you can check to see if you have been put in

I do agree it could be very hard for some folks but try at least a few times in my opinion. Not everyone will be able to do them everytime."
Im not into a lot of MMOs but I can't stop playing it.  I'm 40ish hrs in and I can t wait to finish my daily shit to get back on that grind. I love my minuteman
Same!
Can you share a screenshot of expenses the guild pays though for owning a territory and what not. I would be interesting to see the actual profit margin
"I love that it asks if you want to retry.  Like there is some random rare chance that if you hit yes, you'll no longer be banned"
"The only territories making money are the low lvl ones (Everfall and WW). The rest actually drains the company of money if you upgrade them. 

And unless the governor actually steals from the company it's not the governor making ""300k"" while someone else is making 5 gold."
"I stopped flagging as a casual level 30, when level 50s would kill you.

Its just not worth pvping in a game until you're maxed level and on equal grounds"
"Board quests that reward 1.60, and cost 3.78 to refine the quest items."
Crazy how Amazon has us all doing their QA work for them. And we paid for the privilege.
"For me it was finding out frozen thaw bugged ice storm so you only got 1 tick of damage. I'd been leveling forever and just thought it was garbage and so was about to switch to fire staff.

Then today I find out the t3 Amber gem is also bugged so it's still garbage and if I pick the third ice storm perk that is also bugged and the storm will cancel on weapon switch.

It's genuinely difficult to play normally for the number of bugs."
"For the love of New World…yes please! Damaged goods upon return from a dungeon is insanely annoying, especially given how little things are worth already. Good luck trying to sell that piece of armor for 50 gold when it costs 20 to fix and 6 to post…"
"My story is like the post the other day about how the mid to late 40s kind of suck in game.  Part of that is all the quests for that period require massive travel.  I’ve run so much lately, because I have to save my Azoth for big across the map trips the game keeps calling for.  Add in our faction only having one controlled area, and it’s even worse.

so yeah OP, ditto"
What mats have you used to make it and how many tries did it take to get that?
"Try FFXIV, where the bad healers are the ones who don't do enough damage! (Blinding everyone with spammed Holy is optional)

There again, does Sacred Ground + Beacon actually provide enough healing for those aware enough to use the AoEs, so single target heals are usually not needed. Or are there fights that even with well-equipped and knowledgeable tanks need spammed heals?"
What’s the song?
">However at no time are the clients making decisions or “freezing” characters in place - if character are frozen it is because the client is behind on drawing, but the server simulation continues.

Does this mean I'm lagging because my hardware sucks? I'll upgrade my PC if that will fix it..."
Bruh. Did they really not think people would try to climb around on that stuff?
"This player is a known scumbag.

He's scammed plenty of players. He also afk in Outpost Rush. This is the type of players AGS is fostering when they allow their scummy actions to continue."
"This is what anyone who was cheating says when they get banned. They act as if they didn’t do anything, what they did is just what you’re suppose to do, or they act like they have no idea what exploit they did or insist that they never did the exploit to begin with."
"Fuck this game, just 7days??????"

"If you're just here for PvE, I'd just wait, I made it to level 46 and just got bored as hell (probably has something to do with me being a pure healer, lifestaff/icegauntlet, which is the dullest combo ever), the PvE is such barebones and lack luster at the moment"
Not gonna hit shit though with that ping
"I found this very funny. Just the other day I was running lv65 portals in SM with a large group (3+ groups). I was spreading out my AoE heals for coverage so people could sit in them and fight.

One bow DPS guy would stand 1m from a beacon or heal circle and slowly die to corruption damage, then spam ping heal. I was just stunned, how blind and dumb are some people?"
Nothing worse than losing a 1v1 fight because you swear you swapped off your bow but it's still in your hand as the great axe swings at you lol

"As a rapier bow main i feel your pain, but still, you see the magic users complain about bows... even though the top 10 in every single war in any server are mages... and outpost rush... and pve, and open world, and dungeons...

Its sad but because if u get lucky (with the desyncs) and u headshot someone with all your buffs, distance and skill and do 4k dmg in a 1 in 30 chance shot, u are OP, meanwhile staff users spam u 2.5k shots with way bigger hitbox and no buffing/specific distance requiered."

I am so bummed to hear this from so many people. I am a solo player and honestly don't want to finish leveling now. I don't have time for groups and really like just barely being able to beat stuff. I think I need to find another game.

Does fishing count? Lol I enjoyed weaponsmithing. Because I could play with my dog while crafting 186 great axes
I’m on Ygg as well and it’s disheartening to see so many companies exploiting the name switch. I feel kind of lost on a solution. I wish AGS would speak up definitively about whether that will be punished so companies stop feeling so bold in these exploits.
I don't even care about getting my shit all the way up to 200. I Just want armoring 150 so I can make my final set of bags :(
Reminds me golden days in Rust game. Gj
There is such a vide variation of roles that one can argue even if you could see it. What type of inferences could you even make?
My DAoC past makes me want an open world  forced PvP zone with 3 control points.  Because that was the best PvP ever.
"I wasn't following the launches of GW2 and ESO, but aren't those numbers  normal for launch? SWTOR had 1.8-2 million players after a month or so. 

I wish that New World will thrive but  I don't think there's anything crazy about those numbers. It usually stables after a month or two when you see a fairly big drop out from the game.

If it will manage to keep that number after the honeymoon phase ends - *that* would be crazy, imo."
"A bunch of degens in the comments really have the shortest attention span.

The game literally just came out, chill tf out.

WoW wasn't built in a day, neither will this.

If you max lvl within 3 days and you're bored, thats your fault. Its an MMO**RPG**, not a speed run."
Wait until you go prone that's really broken.
"I agree with everything, but for the love of god let us share quests with our friends. AT LEAST faction quests, as they are literally meant to be done by a group of people working together to beat the other factions. I really don't see a single reason why this shouldn't be possible in this game, maybe someone with more MMO experience have an explanation why you should not be able to, i'm interessted to hear."
For this price ? Whole 2 weeks ? Triple A games dont last that long and are already charging you for dlcs.
"New World is more similar to classic wow than retail wow itself. The focus is on leveling, crafting and social stuff while retail is all about competitive endgame content.

"easy, MachinePiss"
Then there is my sever were nobody has won a single offense in a war and no territories have switched hands yet. Purple has 4 green has 3 and yellow has 2 but no one knows how to attack lmao
The problem is the questing. It's horrible and out right lazy.
Oh look it's the issue we told the devs about 6 months ago in alpha. Neat.
2 weeks is stupid but if you just take the peaks and troughs on that graph you can see the game is trending downwards in players. I’d give it another 3 months without a major update and the game will be close to life support.
"Ahh yes the respawning timer. The respawn timer in great cleave is faster than my damn heals. I as a healer found the respawn a huge problem, yes I'm able to heal myself to 1k+ hp every second indefinitely, but my dps is so low that killing one seems like it spawns 2 or 3 more. I resorted to playing the game like Assassins Creed. See if I can do the quest without anyone spotting me(jumping onto walls so they would retreat)"
"Are people actually buying gold though? 

I don’t think it’s really necessary, it’s not like there is a shortage just from doing general things without playing the trader you get decent gold.

Especially now everyone is catching up in crafting and nothing sells that high anymore."
"So I decided to see just how bad furnishing is after the 100 mark... I'm at 110 furnishing and the most efficient item I've found is to make Tree Stump Side Tables (35 lumber, 10 weak solvent, 2 maple saps).

* 943,740 Aged Wood
* 1,887,480 Green Wood (471,870 Timber)
* 80,230 Weak Solvent
* 5,128 Oil
* 471,870 Sandpaper"
Can you still salvage a broken item?
Do we lose house or does it get inaccessible  till you pay up?
Any recommendations for us east?
Same with Sword and shield. Some skills are great for pvp not so much for PvE
"Just saying, I saw all this stuff before with a certain game called Anthem..."
The chest hunt quest placeholders sure are getting old.
I don’t think they were anticipating how flat the economy was going to be when they made that decision. Hopefully they can get the economy up and going soon
There does seem to be quite a lot to complain about tbh
I’m just treating NW like a single player RPG at this point. No sense trying PVP or fucking with TP till this is all fixed. But once I hit lvl60 I’m out.

"The system they've got is really vulnerable to griefing, whether it's stuff like this or stuff like the Hungarian streamer crashing the Aquila server.

When these folks grief in Minecraft they turn off a few folks running the server. But when they grief a New World server they ruin the game for 1000 people. How many of those people say ""screw it, game X doesn't have this issue so I'll go back to playing it""?"

"Totally agree.  Every couple of levels I hit the AH/TP and check for upgrades.  I don't craft them, I don't loot them, I rarely use quest rewards because I can buy WAY BETTER upgrades that last longer for WAY CHEAPER... and either trash the parts I have to cap out repair parts, and turn around and sell the better BOEs on the market for folks like me."

At the very least Defiant Stance should grant us grit. The pushback/stagger/stuns feel super weird and frankly annoying coming from tanking in just about any other game lol
"The core of this game seems so good but so many exploits and bugs that were ignored by the devs, even ones reported during beta, have killed the economy and endgame. I don't see a fix other than lots of server merges and rollbacks."
"You're just another selfish, greedy casual pve player trying to ruin pvp for people. You don't need that 30% bonus. You also fail to realize that people who are flagged also get killed, this makes them lose out on nodes. 

Please stop ruining pvp games, you have hundreds of mmos that focus on pve."

This is fastest most cost efficient way.  Cheapest (gold wise) is farm yourself but you're looking at many many hours of work.  100s maybe"
I was in the early stages of that fight last night on the green side but Ended up leaving because we were not getting the support from the other green companies. I got on today and noticed that green influence was at 100% and I knew at that point that they freaking cheated. I hope that those green assholes that are cheating get banned permanently.  The way you win matters.
or the fact that ranged mobs spam their shit like a machine gun
"I think if this week goes by without a pretty major update of some sort the game will be pretty much dead. My server looks like its lost about 25% of our players over the last 7 days; despite the holidays being Steam's biggest weekend ever our server actually declined in online population over Thursday and Friday. 

I ahte to say it because I really enjoy New World. But its just been a complete shit show."

"Tonight is the first night since launch I'm not playing and I feel like I'm falling behind. ""Only"" 39."
And then they pm you “bro you healed youre basically cheating 1v1 me no heals”
Game just came out. Make sure the devs see this I would love these kinds of things.
I mean... what would it matter for a regular john doe PvE player like me?

So what is going to happen to all the people who purposely abused the system?
Which server is this? thats pretty balanced.
Sync Party quest givers and enable share.
So is this game going to be unavailable every Wednesday for EU players? Are we allowed to play only 6 days per week?
"You posted proof the game is bleeding more players than it is taking in new.

"I am exactly on the same boat as you. I get to play like 1-3 evenings in a week. Sometimes for about an hour during the day when the baby is napping. Just last week I only played for an hour, during which I was cooking IRL, so I only fished in game. I haven’t bought a house because I fear the taxes would eat me up. I am level 42."
"I used to farm this monster weeks ago when I was a fresh lv60 but didn't know it was this good for gear score. A better place to camp out for this boss than in your video is in this screenshot as you won't have to move or fight any other monsters while you farm up your gear score.

.

Just shoot the boss from this spot and it will run up to you without any other monster aggro, just don't hit the boss while it's running past the soldier/archer.

Good to see. I thought I was on a healthy server that as of last week was still over 1.1k peak. Last 3 days have been under 500 and it's noticeable.
This would be fine if they made it so all perks/stats/talents apply to the character and not the weapon
Do they apply to your secondary weapon? I know the stats do so it wouldn't be insane for the perks to.
What? Don't you like getting Warhammer perks on your light armor you spent days for leveling armoring and crafting?
"For me it’s because the grind factor is gone already. 

No amount of work or hard time spent can equal up to people who were able to abuse bugs which there were so many that affected the economy without punishment. I lost the drive and motivation to want to pursue any of that myself. I play really casually now and that’s not my norm.

I’d assume it’s the same for a lot of other people but they just up and said fuck this and can’t really blame them."

"TBH the dmg should be spread like this:

- light +20% dmg +10% movement

- medium 0% buff 

- heavy -20% dmg -10% movement

—

Heavy should not have the best dmg and best mitigation. It should be good dmg, good mitigation but slow

Light - high dmg, bad mitigation but fast

Medium - jack of all trades, average dmg, mitigation and speed

This ofcourse requires changes to slow and speed perks"

"I maintain that I don't think they hired any actual NARRATIVE DESIGNERS for this game. Usually, copy like this would be handled by writers. I really think it was some game designers (sometimes it's worse - sometimes the actual programmers write copy and hooo boy is that terrible) who had to step up to get it into the game."
The game is still having a issue about gpu problems. Example my 1660ti Rarely goes over 75c even in demanding games like RDR 2 or Metro exodus. but in new world i am at a toasty 83c  yet i am not even at max gpu use in fact i am only at 70 percent. So why is it pushing my temps so high. Friend with a 5700xt has the same issue with temps being pushed far higher than any other title they own. I had to lock to to 30 fps to keep it under 75c.  Until either a driver or new world fixes this.
Thats hot

"I agree, however the volume is wonky. Lower tier fiber goes for more than silk fiber. Green wood goes for more than wyrdwood…. I completely agree you need that pyramid, however where we’re at now, the market is upside down because of the volume of lower tier Mars required PLUS the town board economy. They needed to have some higher tier raw material turn ins, not processed product. A couple tweaks would fix it."

Hmm

"> you cannot move your character to a world set that you have an existing character in.

"Game has great potential. Currently end game is broken. Hoping it's fixed in 3-4 weeks when more 60s show up or it will slowly die off when people realize there is nothing to do other than trade skills, watermark farm, and the odd war if you're lucky enuff to be picked."
"the other materials are trivial, but yeah you need to do a fuckton of big portals, it sucks badly"
The sword should have its own two trees like all weapons. If you pick the shield with it should replace one of the two trees with the shield tree and the shield should level on it's own.
"It's a lot of fun and a great foundation to build upon, but it's very raw, they have a lot of bugs and systems to refine.

They also need a bit more endgame, crafting is a huge grind which is starting to put me off and then watermark farming I'm starting to question why I even need gear when I'm not really that into PvP.

I'm curious to see how the game grows, I'm looking forward to it."
Can confirm. Negative reviews on this subreddit was what made me refund the game.
"Now imagine having to do this solo? Sorry to all who are group centric but not everyone plays during peak times, are extroverted enough to get a group and/or belong to an active server."
Does anyone know if you can increase your watermark by doing outpost rush?

">example buff fire staff light hit by 300-500dmg and it will be perfect)

Why would anyone with a fire staff use a light attack? You only heavy attack with a fire staff unless you need one final quick killing blow."
Completely agree with you! Us gamers also need to learn some patience and wait for our games to be made properly instead of jumping straight to death threats towards developer's when they delay a game.

It's OK son. You were a disappointment from the moment I preme busted. You can't get any worse than that.
This is a golden opportunity for AGS to take action and make an example of malicious players purposely trying to sabotage servers. Would preserve the longevity of the game if they showed back bone when it came to exploitation and associating with it. Would also reaffirm trust in the games progressive betterment if they were the slightest bit bold in such a manner.
At this point I have just stopped caring...which is sad becuase I had so much hope.  But it's like evrytime they pull a string they unravel another part of the game and its getting ridiculous.
This post doesn't fill me with confidence for the future. I would have expected something like 'we are taking steps to ensure this doesn't happen again' or 'we are updating our internal testing processes to detect issues like this in the future'.

Infused leather or silk gloves depending on which is cheaper for you to make.
"It will vary server to server, it's probably the highest tier leather gloves you can make as aged tannin tends to be cheap and you can often pick up fae iron and shadecloth cheaper than iron ingots and linen. 

You can see for certain on this website, for more accurate results you'll need to add custom prices https://gaming.tools/newworld/"
On my server it only cost like 20k to get 100-200 using silk gloves
I'm glad they abandoned the Lord of the rings MMO. Imagine what they would have done to it.

The flavor text makes no sense.
I’ve never closed a game out of frustration so much than I have with New World. It is always when I’ve died in bullshit scenarios where I can’t recover from stagger(s)
"some of the most annoying shit ever is trying to use what is specifically meant to be a *dodge* or a GTFO skill (the backward shot for bow, the fire dash for firestaff as examples) but they each have a start up that you can be staggered in. The amount of times i've died because i'm just not allowed to use the skill i put points into specifically to prevent me from dying is extremely annoying and its almost always a *take a break* moment for me"

Wars are the same my faction very clearly has fewer members than the other two and the people we do have trying to defend or take territory were mid 30s but the other factions had a bunch of 50+s by simply having way more players. It took 5 people beating on one dude to kill them its not even remotely fair
welcome to toxic gaming thats allowed to abuse the system with 0 repercussions
Correct. Nobody cares about each others opinions they just like to pretend. It's all good though. Numbers dont lie.
"Its an eco chamber. A bunch of people created this idea since the early beta that they are going stay at level 15 forever fishing in Windsward and they are the only ones that will have fun doing that, all the other people progressing in the main quest are  ""burning out"" and ""running out of content"".

You can see multiple threads parroting this same delusion everyday. Almost as if doing quests and leveling in a mmo was ""wrong"". 

They managed to create this casual-elitist mentality."
I just can't stand the repetitive quests and no real difference in NPC models. Shame I was super excited for this game.
"My experience is mixed, I am 48 with 130 hours and I love the game there is no mistake there.

But I am currently taking a break because I feel myself getting a bit pissed at the bugs and systems which I feel is down to me just playing too much.

The main things are dungeon keys which I feel are as useful as tits on a bull and the other is the game constantly crashing during corruption zergs which makes you fall behind the pack and lose a lot of xp plus the stress of having to relog every time."
"Lvl 26 and having a lot of fun taking my time, being flagged for pvp makes it a lot more interesting, except for the times I get ganked by two or more dudes 10+ levels higher than me, farming and exploring the world is so enjoyable!!"

"most of it is because every "" + xx% damage"" are additionnal.  


* \+10% alone increase by 1.1
* \+10% & +10% increase by 1.2
* \+10% & +10%  & +30% increase by 1.5  


So if you have 1000 base damage, it will be :

* 10% >> 1100 damages = +10%
* adding +10% >> 1200 damages = +9.09%
* adding +30% >> 1500 damages = +25%
* total from base is +50%.

it can be missleading"
There is a really huge issue with these group activity quests end game. There is almost 0 incentive to help other people do their elite quests unless you have the exact same quest. Getting other people to help you grind a boss down for 25 minutes and all they get is a shit drop isn't gonna fly. You pretty much have to get people to do it just because they have nothing better to do and they're bored.
"My first MMO was tibia, and I started playing on a dial up connection.

Im constantly maxed out on azoth and its pissing me off i waste it all the time
If you just think about this as another payed beta test it's not as bad. Be ready to take a break after you get 60 and come back when/if they can fix the major issues.

The main reason for this, which I've seen first hand, is opposing factions doing a mass sign up and proceeding not to try to win at all. They do this because they want the owners to lose in the hope that defensive structures get downgraded to make taking the territory through war easier.

A real short-sighted design by AGS on this one I feel."
What do you mean by daily faction stuff? Wonder if I'm missing something
"Honestly, EAC has seemingly done absolutely nothing so far in terms of not only bots but bots scripting to always get instant rare pulls from fishing, instant mining, etc

I have absolutely 0 confidence that this is enforcible without abandoning the cheap third party anticheat and putting some actual effort in. Obviously not recommending anyone use it, it was an obvious design decision not to include one, but I wouldn't be waiting with baited breath to see bans start rolling in from people using it either."
MOASS\*
Any mention of what server this is? I've seen this very message and I'm curious if it's the same or if they're on multiple servers?
"I only play this game to gather resources. I already have 240hrs of gameplay.
I basically only did the main quest and the faction quest.
I got to lvl 48 only gathering resources 🤣
But I'm proud to say that I'm 200 in logging, mining and skinning.
All my tables are over 150+ too."
"Coming from a game-rut after tarkov stopped releasing any real new content, that game was rage and stress inducing. This is a great game because it is fun, there's always something to do. If you get bored, you can just change things you're doing. Everyone is supportive in big companies. Definitely excited to hit lvl 60 (lvl 53) and for the upcoming planned expansion!"
Check again lmao
"Gonna be months before anything actually works as described.  Until then, grab your axe, hatchet, or life staff and heavy resilience armor or get destroyed."
"Nice job 

That's a lot of boars

Yes but no.  But yes.  Except when no.
I just stopped playing till they get there shit together. The games good and I like it.. But they don't know what they're doing and it's very clear. I'll come back when the figure alot of this out and stop banning people for no reason.
Does it look good ??
"Well, i still have like 3000 Infused Health Pots from hitting 200 arcana. Should last me a few expansions.

Now reduce Genesis/Lazarus tuning orb requirements and make corrupted shards tradeable and I'll be super hyped up. It's already time gated by Runestone crafting cooldown."
Didn't know what flair to put. Oops.
"This is awesome. I have been savings mats for so long and I'm glad I did.

Question, in stone cutting gear can you proc multiple orbs from one craft? Does it effect the percentage?"
OPR is dead on my server takes an hour to que.
Gonna half agree with this. The Dev communication has definitely gotten much better but the Twitter CM is pretty worthless. When there is a major issue they either go radio silent or post some fluff crap and when someone calls them on it they just resort to sarcasm. Works for DBrand but not for a community wanting ACTUAL communication.
"On a related note, buddy of mine got curious and tested a fishing bot for 30 mins and then uninstalled it. A week later he got a 7 day ban. I guess his offense was far more egregious than dupers and exploiters. I think in those 30 mins he caught a few bass—clearly enough to set him up for life."
"I'm more concerned about the lack of diminishing return on warhammer ridiculously large AoE stuns than great axe...

but GA/ warhammer usually come together"
"now is this an ACTUAL 30%  or a 30% increase on the already tiny luck number ?

so is getting something lucky now 3 in 10 chance

or...a 30% increase on 0.7%  which is still pretty fuck all"
"My only issue with these chests & elite sones changes is that they were not communicated at all, nowhere in the patch, nothing"
Send a ticket to Amazon and request a transfer token. Definitely tell them ur situation like u told us. It’s worth a shot good luck
"Yup. I feel the same way. With a dead server im forced to be a solo player. At lv60 solo player = chopping trees, mining rocks, hunting animals and gather herbs. Which gets boring very fast. 
Dead servers are killing this game fast."
I love the game but I would absolutely leave a negative review.
What are your attributes?
Yea I'll take a break now. There is too many bugs and broken stuff in the game. I love pvp but i HATE the gaxe/stun-train spam. I have to do so much to dodge and avoid that shit and these people just left-click to do heat-seeking autoaiming 2 meters auto-jumping.
Is it just me or are 90% of craftable items terrible? I'm pissed i got hidden truths and now it has mortal lifesteal. And it appears they have slapped mortal something on every weapon. Which is one of the worst perks. Then I swear one of the last two life staves you could make were pure focus and had blessed.  Now I can't find it and the last life staff you can has DEX???!!!! As an attribute. Like wtf.
Just so you know.. 150 is like.. 30% of the needed exp?
"thanks all, appreicate the feedback"
"Farm silver elite lvl 63 until watermark 550 if you can. 

Then do solo chest runs on Mines, Myrk and Siren. Check how to do from youtube videos.

Also the 3 chest from Lapsus and Pullus."
"Newish to the game but I really enjoy gathering and skinning. Mining and Logging I try to save for when I’m near the town so I don’t get encumbered.

Still having some issues with crafting not going though for tailoring but doing a ton of cooking and engineering."
"You're right, but most people have either adopted GA/WH or quit at this point so you're not going to get a lot of agreement on this subreddit. PvP's a fucking joke of getting stunlocked to death by hammer spam on points or run down and massacred by groups of great axes in the open. At least as a musket user you can delete other light/medium players now and punish them for not embracing the cheese meta."
And the stamina of mobs with shields are insane 😂😂 hence why i moved from a musketeer build to a hatchet + GA build. Idk how people levelled up solo as a musketeer to 60.
same as fishing simulator
I hope they add a feature where you can respec your town cards.
"It's really hard to have an informed opinion on this. People will lie, repeatedly. From players to developers. Devs admitting to automated bans would be more insane than having them, and a player admitting to one's own shortcomings is something I wouldn't hold my breath for."
And the plague continues….
So I can't transfer from east coast USA to west coast USA servers when transfers open?
"This is basically my server. Very balanced and everyone fighting everyone. It's faction first, company 2nd for us in the Covenant most of the time. I feel like I got lucky seeing all the drama of other servers"
This sub is 60% complaining and 40% complaining about the complainers
I think people who argue this could always start a thread and post a screenshot using the minimap with name/server to confirm and ping a dev. If they get banned they know it’s against the terms and condition and if not - happy days for you.
"The dev on shrouds stream said they would make an official statement this week by Tuesday, once they had decided their position on the minimal overlays.

How are you specked? Strength and Focus?
Durability Loss from dying to world PVP is worse. I spent half an hour doing world PVP outside of ever Fall last night and when it was over I get hit with about a 300 to 500 gold repair cost plus armor scraps for having fun.
"I just wish I could stop getting BOP of the Soldier gear for my fire staff character. The amount of +int and +int/+con gear I've gotten is terrible. That alone is making not want to watermark farm. I've gotten my drops to the 560 range, and I am still using my 525 faction gear."
"I think MMOs are the only games that can get away with it because you expect consistent updates anyway. 
I don't care because I'm taking the game slow, and exploring. Only playing a few hours here and there. So the occasional Bug can be a little irritating but I'm having a good time and getting my money's worth.

I've learned my lesson with past MMOs not to No Life it.."
How about a 10 day timer.  5 days is BS.
I still think we should be able to rent a room to someone either on our friend list or company. Someone more casual or just not that into farming and such can have some sort of ownership and storage increase potential. Maybe based on the tier house you buy you can rent to 1-2 people.

"Sorry, but the devs are just being stupid at this point. Is it that difficult to just say whether or not the specific addon in question is allowed instead of dancing around the issue with vaguely worded posts. As far as I understand the over-wolf map is allowed since it only ""pulls"" location information from the game."
"So, I decided to Respec to try musket and bow, light gear with decent stats and I deal like 1k or 1.5k. how do you do so much damage? 300dex with opal in weap. Honestly I have no idea what I did wrong, still lvling the weapon tho; is that the problem? Will I improve the damage if I push leveling it up?"
"You can still equip both same weapon if you drag the second weapon from storage.  
You can still do slower rapid fire with flamethrower, but if you spec into flamethrower, you are gimping yourself because you will have to waste 4 points and lose either burnout or lose the elite buff perk runes of helios. So I don't think it's really worth to abuse this weaker version of machine gun."
"Not sure why I assumed you could always sell your house and buy a new one elsewhere. Didn't know you can't sell it. Hmm, I sure hope they change that when the map gets bigger"
"Provided all the materials to my factions armorsmith myself after grinding out my refining skills to 200 (minus stonecutting) and got a bonus proc on one of my voidbent ingots which saved me from buying/farmimg a 5th void ore. 

Just took about 400 hours of game time."
Lol if life staff is nerfed I’m changing to dps instantly.
No wonder people don't do opr because of this dumb mechanic.
"Oh, they are doing something about it, don't worry.

They nerfed bows, they nerf magic.

All that remain is nerfing spear and rapier and we are good."
"There's a certain Healer in every single one of my OPR games who wears heavy armor and places Sacred Ground underneath the teamfights in mid and they are Rank 1 EVERY GAME. No, I'm not exaggerating. 

If healing counts, so should damage. The poor musket/bow users on my team doing work from afar get hardly any points in comparison."
"I’m constantly getting crafting failed - also feels like I’m “stuck” in free look camera mode 

Something happened about 10 days ago and the game became like this - I’ve tried a ton of ways to fix it and I can’t"
"Left my negative last night, if they correct course it will go to positive, but they have to earn it"

"They should do it somewhat like warhammer online city fights. Multiple instances of the war could open up and people can just queue up to enter one of them. Either have these queued ones just reward items, faction tokens or similar. Or let them contribute a toward the resulting settlements attributes. like fort upgrades for the next war, crafting stations etc."
The community is so much worse than the bugs.
"Don't worry, soon you'll be able to buy azoth from the cash shop. /s"

It should be Only gear bound to you takes damage when you die. Resolves the free fast travel without damaging sellable gear to the point of not worth repairing cause you'll lose money if you repair and sell it
"I had to re-roll to east to play with my friends and its been a painful experience releveling.  


If they don't have this stuff figured out by the time im ready to farm at 60, I will AFK until stuff starts getting rectified.  


Its a fun game, its a good game, *its a broken game.*  


Sincerely,  
The guy who played Alpha for 2 years and posted very important feedback while AGS ignored the testers and then wiped the Alpha forum boards for launch."
Bunch of cry babies
"This game is just outright broken right now. Which is a shame, because it's so damn beautiful and the gameplay is great.

Guess it'll take a year or two like most MMO releases nowadays to clean things up."
"Cool story bro, but what they going to do ? Ban the 90,000 players that are using it ?"
Now if we could only get a little more speed on the projectiles of regular arrows. Feels like I'm shooting through water.
"A lot of USA west worlds are dead, I transferred worlds said medium population felt more empty  then the weeboo I left"

"Um, yes, hello? Probably a stupid question but am I the only one that just sees a picture of the New World logo and no list or guide or anything?"
We truly live in a society :(
I though it was going to be the patch with new expeditions and be able to farm them with a very reduce cost of keys. I was wrong.
Take a break guys
Ask the Anthem playerbase how that worked for them.
Just saying I called this after they nerfed the pvp scaling for lower players. They cater to streamers and those that scream loudest. This is why I don't play this game anymore. No longer fun having a huge part of the game missing due to poor scaling.
The competent studios are busy abusing their games thanks
Yes but join a busy server.
Don't!
It changes nothing. You will not flag but wear gear to unlock certain rarer drops. They will flag and have to wear less gathering gear so they are still strong enough to PvP. Them fighting people still makes them slower than you...
I’ll do PvP instances all day long IF they offered at all levels but they don’t. However if I’m out shopping I don’t wanna be ganked. It’s annoying. I’m fine with the incentive but guess what? It STILL doesn’t get me to PvP.
Nothing has changed for you. Your experience is still the same either way.
Finally some interesting and decent post… thanks!
"OPR should have been cross server from the beginning, at least for low-medium pop realms.  It's basically not in the game if you are on low pop."
"Yep but in this business there is humans, they are under pressions by their superiors etc.."
"The unbalance is real. They need to nerf Gaxe and hammer and should not introduce sustain further, instead they should reduce it. Having sustain self-heal as DPS hurts Time-to-kill even more."
Mobs staggering you every hit is a bit ridiculous. Your hits don’t stagger them every time and stop them from attacking.
"Why the hell would anyone get 200 weaponsmithing then? There needs to be a reward for 200 weaponsmithing that is exclusive to the crafter. Almost all games do this.... WoW does the same thing, it has BOE and BOP items."
"For the Steam awards you need to review a game you nominate.  

The list of options shows games you have recently played that were released in the time frame so New World will be a game a lot of people have played even for an hour.   Therefore the fastest way to get the achievement will be to nominate those games listed, including New World for any random category and throw up a 5 word review for it even if you only played it for an hour."
"For me it is the inventory management. Having to split my mats between settlements and not being able to quick access them without paying a considerable amount of gold or spending tons of azoth is a chore. 

Just link all storage sheds like they did with TP and I am good."
This is why I almost always carry hatchet in one slot
"baiscally 0 content, gamebreaking bugs/dupes and market down atleast once a week. Iv been loyal to the game since the start but with other games dropping new content, I have no reason to stick around unless they seriously drop some fresh content and fix performance. Over 70% of the people I know quit the game, can barely fill a war roster anymore."
ayo where can I cop that
"50% committed!
not even on ligh gear, and still have some con to pop on int ... lmao


jks .. WP"
Crippling Powder Burn... Get It (also use flawed sapphires instead of pristine for more damage)
the problem with this will be just like Darkzone from The Division but 10 times worse as you can have 50 people going around in a horde on New world and solo's or small groups are just fcked
"Idk, locking high tier mats behind pvp doesn’t seem like a great idea. “PvE” players will be using high tier mats to craft as well. 

If you flag all the time great, enjoy your xp bonus! Oh wait you already rushed 60…"
